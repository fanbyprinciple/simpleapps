# 3D birthday card

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/fanbyprinciple/pen/NWabZbm](https://codepen.io/fanbyprinciple/pen/NWabZbm).

A Little birthday card I hacked together in an afternoon for my sister's birthday. Uses 3D transforms and such, and a bit of shitty JS for opening and closing the card.

Forked from [Michael Duerinckx](http://codepen.io/michd/)'s Pen [3D birthday card](http://codepen.io/michd/pen/gxFmf/).
