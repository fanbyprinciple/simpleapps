            Happy Birthday Ammaji!
        </div>

        <div id='card'>
            Dear Ammaji,
            
            Thank you for all the little things that you do
            The way you go about your responsibilities without much ado
            Whether donning the white in hospital gown
            Or in the kitchen, stirring up a delicacy of your own
            All work managed with equal aplomb
            and yet find time to fix achu's hair with a skillful comb

            
            I have never seen you fret, never seen you complain
            Melting everyone's heart with dedication for you to reign
            But I know you can be equally stern
            for my ears have endured plenty of cranks and finger turns
            But you know we love and you love us too
            A very happy birthday to you.

            Love,
            Achu and Ami.
