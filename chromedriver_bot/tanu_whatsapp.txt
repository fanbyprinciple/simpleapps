8/5/21, 19:45 - Tanushree: He doesn't feel anything. He feels repulsed. That people are trying to fool him by acting
8/5/21, 19:45 - Tanushree: He doesn't understand bodily emotions. Like crying, happiness, anger etc just by body language

8/13/21, 18:29 - Tanushree: If you can't fantom, then you are not this category 😂
8/13/21, 18:30 - Ashwin: What I feel strange when you say body and mind is
8/13/21, 18:30 - Tanushree: This person basically meant ki
My body maybe an illusion (or stimulation), but I know I can think therefore whatever that exists must be real 😂
8/13/21, 18:30 - Ashwin: Body I can imagine feelings I cant
8/13/21, 18:30 - Ashwin: It's more like I can say
8/13/21, 18:30 - Ashwin: I am body and energy
8/13/21, 18:30 - Tanushree: Anything which takes space
8/13/21, 18:30 - Ashwin: And I quantify whatever that animates me as energy not mind
8/13/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: Energy is vague bcoz now heat is energy, which is physical entity
8/13/21, 18:31 - Ashwin: I cannot exclude the body because it exists what ever else that animates us is intangible
8/13/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: Mental, mind, soul is not
8/13/21, 18:31 - Ashwin: So how do you quantify
8/13/21, 18:31 - Ashwin: Lo ye lo
8/13/21, 18:31 - Ashwin: Soul bhi aa gya
8/13/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: Yes
8/13/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: Everything which doesn't take space,
Wo different hota h body se
8/13/21, 18:32 - Ashwin: Energy is vague because it's a physical entity while feelings aren't? Do you hear yourself girrrl
8/13/21, 18:32 - Ashwin: It's just that to understand stuff that's abstract we haven't processed yet we have given it placeholder of feelings
8/13/21, 18:33 - Tanushree: That's not me
That's the guy who said 'I think, therefore I am' 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: And in order to show our self importance we also have the concept of soul something which makes it possible to be righteous from thin air because if the "soul"
8/13/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: All are conveniences to explain stuff
8/13/21, 18:33 - Tanushree: He said that he can doubt the exist of his body
But he firmly believes his mind is not his body and that exists
8/13/21, 18:34 - Tanushree: There are many schools of thinking. They all say different things
Layman people mix all of them together, that's why such issues
8/13/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: It's like saying I belive in this because I can't see it but I doubt it's existence even though it's right there
8/13/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: Behaviourism doesn't believe anything like consciousness exists
Dualism me body and mind is different
Functionalism me mind is more important than body
8/13/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: You calling me layman
8/13/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: Very snide of you
8/13/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: You said you believe in this, that's why I said you are dualism
Now you are contradicting yourself 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: Because dualism
8/13/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: Dualist*
8/13/21, 18:36 - Ashwin: No what I am saying is. There are different schools of thought. All seeking to explain one concept.
8/13/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: See I have proof 😂
8/13/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: Which concept?
8/13/21, 18:36 - Ashwin: Now are we ready to believe that there's one truth? If we are then all of these theories must be true simultaneously.
8/13/21, 18:37 - Ashwin: Concept of who I am
8/13/21, 18:37 - Tanushree: Not all theories believe that
8/13/21, 18:37 - Ashwin: In physic66for example we don't have a universal truth yet the theories don't contradict
8/13/21, 18:38 - Ashwin: Okay if they don't then the only condition in which they would be true is individually. So there are emany truths. If there are many truths what's the use of postulating
8/13/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: Newtonian and Quantum physics don't contract?
8/13/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: Contradict*
8/13/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: Many hypothesis 😂
8/13/21, 18:39 - Ashwin: :Newtonian" physics is more like a heuristic in the present day to explain physics ti macro body. It's an estimation.
8/13/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Yet they contradict each other on small and large partical structures
8/13/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: What j am saying is Newton is non canon in physics
8/13/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Noncanon?
8/13/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: While quantum mechanics is canon
8/13/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Canon kon camera?
8/13/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
8/13/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Ohhh
8/13/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Isme rakha h camera ka name 😂
8/13/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
8/13/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
8/13/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: Everything is on google man nowadays
8/13/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: We should just download the data into our brain
8/13/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: Yours is a happening field
8/13/21, 18:44 - Tanushree: Haan and I download the meaning in canon
8/13/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: Leeme reas
8/13/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: Lemme reas?
8/13/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: Read
8/13/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: 😂
8/13/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: 🐣🐣
8/13/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: Haan toh dimag me download karti rahu me😂
8/13/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: 🤓🤓
8/13/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Kya bolre the aap?
8/13/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Canon wala?
8/13/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Padh liya ye 😂
8/13/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: What I am saying is there is no contradiction
8/13/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: What I am saying is if the different school of thoughts cannot be explained to a Layman in a consistent manner then it means
8/13/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: Psychologists are not rigorous enough to weed out inconsistent theories or if they are useful keep them but acknowledge they are wrong
8/13/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: Or just speculation
8/13/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: Okay
8/13/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: Maybe
8/13/21, 18:48 - Ashwin: Okay
8/13/21, 18:48 - Ashwin: Wow
8/13/21, 18:48 - Ashwin: You accept?
8/13/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: No
8/13/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: I'm typing
8/13/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:48 - Ashwin: 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: I'm typing the relevance of theories which when replicated are being accepted karke
8/13/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: Bcoz acceptance tab hoga jab replicable hoga
8/13/21, 18:50 - Ashwin: But if two theories are divergent and can be "replicated" on mutually exclusive samples what does that mean
8/13/21, 18:50 - Ashwin: It means you theory is not good enough
8/13/21, 18:50 - Tanushree: It just means that physics and psychology is not the same?
8/13/21, 18:50 - Ashwin: Yes one is science and other is not
8/13/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: Nd theory formation is not is important
8/13/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: And replication in both is important
8/13/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: One a layman can understand by using his brain while other needs imagination
8/13/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: Yes
8/13/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: So one person should not be taunted that he is a layman so he can't understand
8/13/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: One is in books, yes
8/13/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: He just can't believe your lies
8/13/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: I didn't give any theories 😂
8/13/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂😂
8/13/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Personal attac
8/13/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Dirty play
8/13/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: I just read all the theories in circulation
8/13/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Standard fare in debates
8/13/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Haanji round Robin karte h
8/13/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: And chose to research on that to find if that works and how that can be applied 😂
8/13/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Roster hi rakh lete h
8/13/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: But in a way it's good
8/13/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: Nahi 😂😂
I usually go by 'awaz ku upar kar raha h?, Normal baat kar na?' 😂
8/13/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: But very limiting to you
8/13/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: It is very limiting actually
8/13/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
8/13/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: And I think that's what I like
8/13/21, 18:54 - Ashwin: If you play Russian roulette with the ideas
8/13/21, 18:54 - Ashwin: Instead of finding something g out of the box you'll be stuck with Descartes going loony over ri think therfore I am
8/13/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: No
8/13/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: You subscribed to that, I didn't 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: I have a classmate
8/13/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: And his work is on machine learning, diffusion models etc
8/13/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: And meko kabhi samjh ni aaya wo kya kara hai thesis me
8/13/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: I use questionnaire, fmri, eeg stuff
8/13/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: So usne ek baar bola tha. Clinical work is too subjective, asking people what they feel. Even people don't know what they feel. Kya faida esi studies ka
8/13/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: Not in a personal way, bas his opinion
8/13/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: And last month his brother committed suicide
8/13/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: And this month his work switched to emotional studies
8/13/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: Wahi interviews, questionnaires wagera
8/13/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: Fuck
8/13/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: Hmm
8/13/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: It didn't take him a month to switch his research field
8/13/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: Bas 2 mahine people he was calling such things crap
8/13/21, 18:58 - Tanushree: So I feel the limiting nature of this field is so abstract, it's even more fun knowing
8/13/21, 18:58 - Tanushree: But ya I know ye mental state ki baat h (which is mental) 😂😂
8/13/21, 18:59 - Ashwin: Even when you know you don't know but it will always satisfy your curiosity
8/13/21, 18:59 - Tanushree: Yaa
8/13/21, 18:59 - Tanushree: It always helps feeling that you are one step closer to helping a cause (any cause)
8/13/21, 19:00 - Tanushree: Ulte direction me ho, wo alag baat 😂😂
8/13/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: Hmm
8/13/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: That's good
8/13/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: How is your classmate now
8/13/21, 19:00 - Tanushree: Closed off
8/13/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: He doesn't like to discuss such things
8/13/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: We don't
8/13/21, 19:01 - Ashwin: Yeah
8/13/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: Bas ek dusre ko PhD positions bhejte 😂
8/13/21, 19:01 - Ashwin: Hehehe
8/13/21, 19:01 - Ashwin: That's nice atleast
8/13/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: He didn't even tell me himself
8/13/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: When I asked him, kuch pata laga? He just said kuch ni pata
8/13/21, 19:02 - Tanushree: His friend told me, jo uske gaon me rehta
8/13/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: Accha
8/13/21, 19:02 - Tanushree: Bhaagna ni aaj?
8/13/21, 19:02 - Tanushree: 😂
8/13/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: Hmm pretty serious this

8/15/21, 09:55 - Ashwin: I can only substrate. True
8/15/21, 09:55 - Tanushree: Angrezi, repetative words, incorrect grammar
8/15/21, 09:55 - Tanushree: This only
8/15/21, 09:56 - Ashwin: Haan that only hi
8/15/21, 09:56 - Ashwin: Okay ye c1 b2 c2

8/15/21, 14:49 - Tanushree: Did you have a look?
8/15/21, 14:50 - Tanushree: I'm thinking of submitting. I don't understand the German timings so their deadline timings may have some differences.
8/15/21, 14:51 - Ashwin: Okay gimme 1 hour
8/15/21, 14:54 - Ashwin: Paradigms and methods are synonymous

8/15/21, 14:54 - Ashwin: Ok
8/15/21, 14:55 - Tanushree: Paradigms are kind of the experiement structure, like gonogo
Method is fmri, eeg, eyetracker etc
8/15/21, 14:58 - Ashwin: Approach and avoidance behaviours are the primary symptoms in most disorders
8/15/21, 14:58 - Ashwin: I think don't make definitive statements who know the person who is reading it would have worked contrary to it
8/15/21, 14:59 - Tanushree: Nahi they are. Fact hai ye
8/15/21, 14:59 - Tanushree: Although you can add personal statement
8/15/21, 15:00 - Tanushree: Comments*

8/15/21, 15:14 - Ashwin: I have made changes some. Very well written for most part
8/15/21, 15:15 - Ashwin: But you have a tendency to use long winded sentences which I tried to break down just review if the flow is broken

8/16/21, 10:35 - Tanushree: You mean I take things for granted that's why I'm not satisfied? 😐
8/16/21, 10:35 - Ashwin: Yoss
8/16/21, 10:35 - Ashwin: Truth hurts
8/16/21, 10:35 - Tanushree: 😢😢
8/16/21, 10:35 - Tanushree: I don't know how should I change it?
8/16/21, 10:40 - Ashwin: 🤣🤣
8/16/21, 10:40 - Ashwin: I never thought you would agree
8/16/21, 10:40 - Tanushree: Probably
8/16/21, 10:40 - Tanushree: I feel
8/16/21, 10:40 - Tanushree: So
8/16/21, 10:41 - Tanushree: I'm not easily satisfied with things
8/16/21, 10:41 - Tanushree: I don't know why
8/16/21, 10:41 - Ashwin: But then only way to regain your child like wonder is by relearning
8/16/21, 10:41 - Tanushree: Kaafi vague advice ni? 😂
8/16/21, 10:41 - Ashwin: Like in academy I was deprived of life as we know it
8/16/21, 10:42 - Ashwin: So I guess I started liking a life of less
8/16/21, 10:42 - Ashwin: Wants and needs were portioned
8/16/21, 10:42 - Tanushree: Meko samjh ni aara
8/16/21, 10:42 - Ashwin: It's okay
8/16/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: Pehle I myself don't want to do anything, then I lose interest in everything
8/16/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: Then I don't have anything to do
8/16/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: As if I need someone to force me to do things
8/16/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: I crib so much
8/16/21, 10:44 - Ashwin: Hmm
8/16/21, 10:44 - Tanushree: Anyway

8/18/21, 17:57 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
8/19/21, 07:19 - Ashwin: any idea what I am looking at? https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/10605/kernels-to-compute-second-order-derivative-of-digital-image
8/19/21, 08:18 - Tanushree: This is applied nature of derivation. I don't know this 😂
They are taking image derivates here using sobel filter. There are various types of filters used, however I don't know which one is used when.
People use this in our field to clean out the EEG or fMRI data. So I'll give a chotu sa example if that helps.
8/19/21, 08:19 - Tanushree: This message was deleted
8/19/21, 08:20 - Tanushree: So when we take brain scans, there are various regions which are more salient or brighter than the other ones (they refer to activation in the brain). 
Now these derivatives are used to measure which region in the brain scan is the brightest and by how much.
8/19/21, 08:20 - Tanushree: So idk what they are trying to do exactly. But they are comparing the saliency of the regions.
8/19/21, 08:25 - Tanushree: Convolution basically done to smoothen out an image so the that bright regions are enhanced. Ek chote se area ko lete hain isme, and surrounding areas k basis p central area ka value nikalte
8/19/21, 08:25 - Tanushree: I don't know how much sense I make 😂😂
8/19/21, 08:31 - Ashwin: You make much sense tanu
8/19/21, 08:31 - Ashwin: Actually here these kernel filters can be used for multiple things
8/19/21, 08:31 - Ashwin: Like with a different kind of filter you detect edges or smoothen images etc
8/19/21, 08:32 - Ashwin: Here they would be using the filter to get second derivative of the image values
8/19/21, 08:33 - Ashwin: My question being how did they come up with this filter I  mean
8/19/21, 08:33 - Ashwin: It couldn't be just trial and error righttt
8/19/21, 08:38 - Ashwin: https://youtu.be/k7QniTYNsmQ
8/19/21, 08:39 - Tanushree: Itna specific pehle hote toh me kahaani ni batati na itni 😂😂
8/19/21, 08:41 - Tanushree: Different filters are more or less sensitive towards noise. Kuch edge detection me better hota, kuch kam. So noise and derivative k hisab se lete.
8/19/21, 08:41 - Tanushree: But I'm not sure konsa wala kab lete. I can ask my senior if it's relevant 👻
8/19/21, 08:43 - Ashwin: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
8/19/21, 08:44 - Ashwin: Sorry
8/19/21, 08:44 - Ashwin: Yhi pta karna h

8/19/21, 08:47 - Tanushree: This song is pure noise 😂😂
8/19/21, 08:47 - Tanushree: How many filters you generally use?
8/19/21, 08:48 - Tanushree: I wish mujhe ye sab na sikhna pade 😂😂 lifetime ni karna itna maths
8/19/21, 09:04 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/KTsBK0jJGxc
8/19/21, 09:04 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
8/19/21, 09:04 - Ashwin: I've used only the edge detection one
8/19/21, 09:05 - Ashwin: And now the book wants me to find second derivative one
8/19/21, 09:05 - Ashwin: Karna toh padega hi
8/19/21, 09:07 - Tanushree: Baki bhi ho jaate. Edge detection k liye I guess sobel and Pickett karke kuch hai. Wo ache hote. Laplace wala noise ni cleaf karta sahi se.
8/19/21, 09:07 - Ashwin: She is a good sport
8/19/21, 09:07 - Tanushree: Admission p depend karta kahan milega 🥲 nahi toh ni karna padega wo b 😂😂😂

8/23/21, 09:53 - Ashwin: I meant what skills!
8/23/21, 10:05 - Tanushree: What skills? 😂 I forget what I send
8/23/21, 10:06 - Tanushree: What you think about the amazon stocks? They are rather unstable or atleast not profitable (jitna meko chamka), why?
8/23/21, 10:54 - Ashwin: Why are you worried about Amazon?
8/23/21, 10:54 - Ashwin: It's not listed in nse or bse
8/23/21, 10:54 - Ashwin: But I am not sure of the answer
8/23/21, 10:57 - Tanushree: Trying to understand
8/23/21, 10:58 - Tanushree: They are investing alot still.
8/23/21, 13:10 - Ashwin: Amazon would go grow steadily.
8/23/21, 13:17 - Tanushree: Oh I'm thinking of opening my demat account.
8/23/21, 13:17 - Tanushree: Tata elxsi and lalpath lab 😂
Prolly other tech companies also.
8/23/21, 13:17 - Tanushree: So which companies you are opting for (if any)
8/23/21, 13:34 - Ashwin: Okay the company I opted for
8/23/21, 13:34 - Ashwin: On a whim
8/23/21, 13:34 - Ashwin: Are idbconebankc, ongc, itc and tata motors
8/23/21, 13:34 - Ashwin: These are bullish stocks right now
8/23/21, 13:34 - Ashwin: Good initiative 👏
8/23/21, 13:35 - Ashwin: Do you have capital to invest?
8/23/21, 13:37 - Tanushree: Ohkayyy
8/23/21, 13:37 - Tanushree: Chalo dekhte. I didn't know my father also invests casually
8/23/21, 13:37 - Tanushree: Imma start small
8/23/21, 13:38 - Tanushree: Maybe 500-1k each year
8/23/21, 13:38 - Tanushree: I'll consult before deciding. Rn whimsical only
8/23/21, 13:38 - Tanushree: Tata motors se better Tata communication ku ni?
8/23/21, 13:39 - Tanushree: Why no idbc over any other bank?
8/23/21, 13:48 - Ashwin: It's like asking gulag jamun se better Gujarat ka halwa kyun nhi?
8/23/21, 13:48 - Ashwin: Halwe ka season nhi
8/23/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: Tata motors is in red compared to tcs. To put it simply. I feel like that once the automobile industry bounces back the situation would improve
8/23/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: All other banks require a lot of capital to invest I was looking for a bank whose per share value is less and is reliable
8/23/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: I actually invested on a whim looking at companies that were safe to invest in, so that even if they are red they are not obsolete, just for testing waters
8/23/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: But how are you suddenly interested 🤔
8/23/21, 13:56 - Ashwin: It's good though
8/23/21, 14:09 - Tanushree: All my tech friends are suggesting this. I thought my father isn't usually interested in such things but even invests.
8/23/21, 14:09 - Tanushree: And meko jo paise milte hain, I have this pattern that I save for few months then suddenly spend them all
8/23/21, 14:10 - Tanushree: Toh socha rakhi wale paise invest kar deti hu else I'll eventually eat that 😂
8/23/21, 14:10 - Tanushree: So I should look for something which is recently down
8/23/21, 14:13 - Ashwin: Yes
8/23/21, 14:13 - Ashwin: Download et Market  app from play store
8/23/21, 14:13 - Ashwin: For watching stocks
8/23/21, 14:14 - Tanushree: Just for watching?
8/23/21, 14:15 - Tanushree: Okayy
8/23/21, 14:15 - Tanushree: Zerodha or upstox?

8/25/21, 22:59 - Tanushree: Which ones
8/25/21, 22:59 - Ashwin: Itc and ongc
8/25/21, 22:59 - Ashwin: The thing is these companies are stable
8/25/21, 22:59 - Tanushree: Too stable 😂
8/25/21, 22:59 - Ashwin: However they take a long time to give you profit
8/25/21, 22:59 - Ashwin: So it was like my cash was locked in
8/25/21, 23:00 - Tanushree: Thoda b profit ni tha? Ki bech sako?
8/25/21, 23:00 - Ashwin: Instead first you need to identify for yourself fhow stocks move and how volatile company work
8/25/21, 23:00 - Ashwin: I sold it for a profit of 1500
8/25/21, 23:00 - Ashwin: Haha
8/25/21, 23:00 - Ashwin: Sorry ongc
8/25/21, 23:00 - Ashwin: Itc is still down
8/25/21, 23:01 - Tanushree: 30k ko 31500 p vecha?
8/25/21, 23:01 - Ashwin: Nhi only the ongc components

8/25/21, 23:01 - Tanushree: Ok ok 😊
8/25/21, 23:01 - Ashwin: Yes. Hopefully
8/25/21, 23:01 - Ashwin: But when you sell you need some money in your account too
8/25/21, 23:02 - Ashwin: Like 20 percent of stocks you are selling
8/25/21, 23:02 - Ashwin: This I was not aware
8/25/21, 23:02 - Tanushree: Ye toh meko b ni pata. Kya matlab?
8/25/21, 23:03 - Ashwin: Like if you sell a stock for 1000
8/25/21, 23:03 - Ashwin: You need to have 200 in your zerodha
8/25/21, 23:03 - Ashwin: So I had to pump in more money
8/25/21, 23:03 - Ashwin: Atleast
8/25/21, 23:03 - Tanushree: For!?

8/25/21, 23:04 - Tanushree: Any opinion on small case?
8/25/21, 23:05 - Ashwin: I think small case more or less makes it like a mutual fund
8/25/21, 23:05 - Ashwin: Tanmay has made it popular
8/25/21, 23:05 - Tanushree: But you can sell it anytime no?
8/25/21, 23:05 - Tanushree: Unlike mutual funds
8/25/21, 23:06 - Tanushree: A guy named Ankur with a sexy voice also recommended. And the video you sent, akshat or whatever
8/25/21, 23:16 - Ashwin: Yeahhhh
8/25/21, 23:16 - Ashwin: I actually don't have much idea regarding smallcase
8/25/21, 23:17 - Ashwin: I would rather like to understand the markets
8/25/21, 23:17 - Tanushree: Wo toh wese bhi daalke samjh aana hi h. Hai toh wo bhi stocks bhi

8/28/21, 01:05 - Ashwin: See in an organization they need all kinds of people
8/28/21, 01:05 - Ashwin: Mostly to avoid groupthink
8/28/21, 01:05 - Ashwin: And I guess the officers at ssb are taught this
8/28/21, 01:05 - Tanushree: Kuch log toh galti se bhi aa hi jaate 😂

8/30/21, 15:26 - Ashwin: But no famous person as such
8/30/21, 15:27 - Tanushree: No template person?
8/30/21, 15:27 - Ashwin: Essentially those who do the  boring work of public sector investments never get famous anyway.
8/30/21, 15:27 - Ashwin: Warren buffet got famous in his 40s when his compound interest popped peoples eyeballd
8/30/21, 15:27 - Ashwin: No
8/30/21, 15:28 - Ashwin: Have you found anyone
8/30/21, 15:28 - Tanushree: I like many people 😂
8/30/21, 15:28 - Tanushree: My standards are low
8/30/21, 15:28 - Ashwin: Like like?
8/30/21, 15:28 - Ashwin: I also have many crushes
8/30/21, 15:28 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
8/30/21, 15:28 - Tanushree: Crushes is different
8/30/21, 15:28 - Ashwin: 😂😂
8/30/21, 15:29 - Ashwin: Okay hit me with an example
8/30/21, 15:29 - Tanushree: Okay she is no big role model and she is just an actress but love her
8/30/21, 15:29 - Tanushree: Reese Witherspoon?
8/30/21, 15:29 - Ashwin: Yeah
8/30/21, 15:29 - Ashwin: Legally blonde
8/30/21, 15:29 - Tanushree: Yaa
8/30/21, 15:29 - Tanushree: So it's okay she did movies and all
8/30/21, 15:29 - Tanushree: Many actors do
8/30/21, 15:30 - Tanushree: But I feel the expresses her values in her work
8/30/21, 15:30 - Tanushree: She wanted to empower women
8/30/21, 15:30 - Tanushree: So she started her segment which are women centric only
8/30/21, 15:30 - Tanushree: Movies, clothing lines
8/30/21, 15:30 - Tanushree: These are normal things only, but the way they are designed
8/30/21, 15:31 - Tanushree: Hiring, the idea behind the theme, the faces they pic
8/30/21, 15:31 - Tanushree: It's profitable and also helping a section of people
8/30/21, 15:32 - Tanushree: I don't like people just saying they have certain values or whatever and I don't take even minor actions towards that
8/30/21, 15:32 - Ashwin: Okay
8/30/21, 15:32 - Ashwin: You have an example closer back home
8/30/21, 15:32 - Tanushree: My role models are simple 😂
8/30/21, 15:32 - Ashwin: Anushka sharma
8/30/21, 15:32 - Tanushree: Yes
8/30/21, 15:32 - Tanushree: Kinda like her
8/30/21, 15:33 - Ashwin: She started a production house when she had done a single film
8/30/21, 15:33 - Ashwin: And has many women centric intiatives
8/30/21, 15:33 - Tanushree: But her roles don't vibe with me na?
8/30/21, 15:33 - Ashwin: Not to mention  the multi bagger investment
8/30/21, 15:33 - Ashwin: Of the decade
8/30/21, 15:34 - Ashwin: Viral kohli
8/30/21, 15:34 - Tanushree: Plus jitna I know her (never tried going deep anyway), mujhe ni pata uske value alignments kya hain
8/30/21, 15:34 - Tanushree: Reese is rather outspoken so I know
8/30/21, 15:34 - Ashwin: That's understandable
8/30/21, 15:34 - Ashwin: Okay
8/30/21, 15:34 - Ashwin: But it is kinda problematic to have role models like that
8/30/21, 15:34 - Ashwin: The thing is she was an actor first
8/30/21, 15:35 - Ashwin: Which gave her a launching pad far beyond what a person like me can achieve right now
8/30/21, 15:35 - Ashwin: You should pick role models who may give you with an actionable step from you
8/30/21, 15:35 - Ashwin: Rest are good for inspiration
8/30/21, 15:35 - Tanushree: The scale is not important
8/30/21, 15:36 - Tanushree: I personally consider myself rather privileged
8/30/21, 15:36 - Tanushree: Not in financial terms maybe
8/30/21, 15:36 - Tanushree: But I can take my own decisions which will ultimately have an impact
8/30/21, 15:36 - Tanushree: Doing what is in capacity is enough
8/30/21, 15:36 - Tanushree: I'm not comparing anyway
8/30/21, 15:37 - Ashwin: That's good 👍
8/30/21, 15:37 - Ashwin: But then you are your own person
8/30/21, 15:37 - Ashwin: You should be able to compare yourself with your role model
8/30/21, 15:37 - Ashwin: Is my take on it
8/30/21, 15:38 - Tanushree: Sabke sath kuch na kuch toh common nikal hi aata h na
8/30/21, 15:38 - Ashwin: Haan
8/30/21, 15:38 - Tanushree: Tabhi toh we 'vibe' 😂
8/30/21, 15:38 - Ashwin: Everyone belongs to species homosapie
8/30/21, 15:38 - Ashwin: You vibe with the actor
8/30/21, 15:38 - Ashwin: Which teffectively translates into real world persona
8/30/21, 15:38 - Tanushree: It's sarcastic but then it is true also 😂
8/30/21, 15:39 - Ashwin: Unless she does something bizarre like kangna renaut
8/30/21, 15:39 - Tanushree: This was just an example bcoz subhe subhe uska book club dekha tha mene 😂
8/30/21, 15:39 - Tanushree: She is not the only one
8/30/21, 15:39 - Tanushree: Like take amazing 10 people and cherry pick your favourite and achievable traits
8/30/21, 15:39 - Ashwin: It's true but in all practicality you can consider yourself and Mukesh Ambani son to be of different species 😂
8/30/21, 15:40 - Tanushree: We both fat tho 😂
8/30/21, 15:40 - Ashwin: Okay yeah that makes sense
8/30/21, 15:41 - Ashwin: Hehe
8/30/21, 15:41 - Ashwin: Like that yes I do feel "inspired" by different traits of people
8/30/21, 15:42 - Tanushree: Haan
8/30/21, 15:42 - Tanushree: I mean
8/30/21, 15:42 - Tanushree: While I don't particularly like the personality taste of sudha Murthy
8/30/21, 15:42 - Tanushree: She maybe a role model too
8/30/21, 15:42 - Tanushree: Galti se laga?
8/30/21, 15:42 - Ashwin: Nhi
8/30/21, 15:42 - Tanushree: Lemme go outside

9/2/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: Usually for sciatica glutes is a major muscle group to target
9/2/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: As it also is linked with other muscles in the spine

9/2/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: It might be due  to some nerve compression
9/2/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: It is not because you are walking wrong
9/2/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: It might just be when you walk we never engage our glutes or stomach
9/2/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: Oh okay. Ya I don't

9/16/21, 23:06 - Ashwin: https://www.google.com/amp/s/simpleflying.com/jet-airways-shares-restricted/amp/
9/17/21, 00:29 - Tanushree: But then how are the share prices rising?
9/17/21, 00:29 - Tanushree: Everyday 5%
9/17/21, 00:29 - Tanushree: Jabse news aya h ki tata might buy them?
9/17/21, 07:46 - Ashwin: But share prices how do they increase? Is it only upto the retail investors
9/17/21, 07:46 - Ashwin: Or if the company does well then also it increases no
9/17/21, 07:50 - Tanushree: But the company is not functioning. There is no profit. There are just talks that tata will buy
9/17/21, 07:50 - Tanushree: Jet airways is bankrupt na
9/17/21, 07:50 - Ashwin: Okay but then how come the price is at 98
9/17/21, 07:51 - Ashwin: There would be some part of jet airways which is till profitable
9/17/21, 07:51 - Ashwin: Like videocon when it got bankrupt
9/17/21, 07:51 - Ashwin: Still had shares in oil refinery companies
9/17/21, 07:51 - Ashwin: Which prompted verdant to buy it
9/17/21, 07:52 - Tanushree: If the shares of other companies are affecting the prices of jet airways, then why did it increase so significantly after the stocks of Tatas buying them?
9/17/21, 07:52 - Ashwin: There would be some wing in jet airways like license or supply chain management , logistics support which makes it functional even when no flight take off
9/17/21, 07:52 - Tanushree: Has to be relevant to the airways part only na?
9/17/21, 07:53 - Tanushree: The prices have gone up after speculations?
9/17/21, 07:53 - Ashwin: It means it has potential value since a reputed firm is trying to buy in
9/17/21, 07:53 - Ashwin: So most of the share is with private investors
9/17/21, 07:53 - Tanushree: I don't think it's because the company has made their profit
9/17/21, 07:53 - Ashwin: Who bought it when it got bankrupt
9/17/21, 07:53 - Ashwin: Shares can exchange hands privately still right
9/17/21, 07:54 - Tanushree: Samjh ni aya
9/17/21, 07:54 - Ashwin: I have to look up how prices are decided first before I can give a definitive answer
9/17/21, 07:54 - Tanushree: Okayyy
9/17/21, 07:54 - Ashwin: You can also do

9/17/21, 23:33 - Ashwin: I bought it at its absolute peak somehow
9/17/21, 23:35 - Ashwin: I realized two things
1. Never go for a stock that's already hyped up beyond 3 percent.
2. Do the due diligence.
3. Bonus : don't put all eggs in one basket
9/17/21, 23:55 - Tanushree: Sounds terrific 😂😂😂 who?

9/18/21, 20:47 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
9/18/21, 20:47 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
9/18/21, 20:47 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>

9/18/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: Mera kaam as a good mitra is to tell 🤭
9/18/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: Mera kaam as a good Mitra is to consider
9/18/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: And frankly
9/18/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: Most what you have recommended me have done well
9/18/21, 20:49 - Ashwin: It's just either me being late or not able to do it
9/18/21, 20:49 - Ashwin: 👍👍
9/18/21, 20:49 - Tanushree: Hehe compliment 🤭
9/18/21, 20:49 - Tanushree: Dekh lena ek baar still
9/18/21, 20:54 - Ashwin: Haan
9/18/21, 20:55 - Ashwin: Dekh lunga
9/18/21, 20:55 - Ashwin: Tumne subscribe kaise kiya tha ami
9/18/21, 20:55 - Ashwin: Organics
9/18/21, 20:55 - Ashwin: Ya retail mein liya tha
9/18/21, 20:55 - Ashwin: Quantity is very less though
9/18/21, 20:55 - Ashwin: How was your day
9/18/21, 20:57 - Tanushree: Mene buy ni kiya hai kuch. Bas mene fill kiye hain details, ki jis din aye meko notification aye. Else I'll forget
9/18/21, 20:57 - Tanushree: Quantity is less? It is still 15k approx 😂
9/18/21, 20:58 - Tanushree: Avai sa tha. Nothing nice
9/18/21, 21:19 - Ashwin: 85
9/18/21, 21:19 - Ashwin: Kahan
9/18/21, 21:19 - Ashwin: Aww
9/18/21, 21:26 - Tanushree: Not like you'll 100% get the allotment anyway.
9/18/21, 21:26 - Tanushree: Yaar wahi ekdam niche aata option
9/18/21, 21:29 - Ashwin: Okay okay
9/18/21, 21:29 - Ashwin: You are right whatever you said
9/18/21, 21:30 - Tanushree: What did I say tho?
9/18/21, 21:56 - Ashwin: I don't know what 100 percent allotment means
9/18/21, 21:56 - Ashwin: :)
9/18/21, 22:02 - Tanushree: Agar they have only 10 allotments but 20 people apply, that means 10/20 will not get allotment. Their money will be reimbursed
9/18/21, 22:02 - Tanushree: So since it's an attractive ipo, many people will apply (some use multiple demat account, papa mumy bhai chacha whatever). So it's kinda a lottery
9/18/21, 22:06 - Ashwin: Ahh yeah
9/18/21, 22:06 - Ashwin: But what does slumber 85 signify
9/18/21, 22:06 - Ashwin: That there are only 85 shares available?
9/18/21, 22:06 - Ashwin: Is it first come first serve then?
9/18/21, 22:07 - Tanushree: No. Kinda lottery
9/18/21, 22:07 - Ashwin: Okay gotchu
9/18/21, 22:07 - Tanushree: Bohot saara stocks hain, isliye unhe bundles me daal diya h
Instead of 1 banana, you have to buy 1 dozen
9/18/21, 22:08 - Tanushree: 1 me 85 stocks.
1 ki value agar 150hai
Then 85 ki 85×150 hogi
9/18/21, 22:08 - Tanushree: Basically you are buying 85 bpcl. You can buy more, but not less
9/18/21, 22:08 - Ashwin: Okay understood
9/18/21, 22:09 - Ashwin: How did you snag ami organics
9/18/21, 22:09 - Ashwin: Jo profit dikhaya tha tumne
9/18/21, 22:09 - Tanushree: I didn't yaar 😂

9/18/21, 22:27 - Tanushree: Haan

9/18/21, 22:29 - Ashwin: His greatest axiom was never to invest in a business you don't know
9/18/21, 22:30 - Ashwin: Because it's very easy to fleece your money
9/18/21, 22:30 - Ashwin: By more experienced people
9/18/21, 22:30 - Tanushree: I agree
9/18/21, 22:30 - Ashwin: I am at a similar stage in stock
9/18/21, 22:30 - Ashwin: But atleast there is some indication
9/18/21, 22:30 - Tanushree: Apka risk meko samjh ni aata 😂

9/24/21, 21:18 - Ashwin: Like they would want to feel equal sometimes is what I think
9/24/21, 21:18 - Tanushree: Sure sure
9/24/21, 21:18 - Ashwin: 🤚
9/24/21, 21:18 - Tanushree: I know those things can be funny, but I don't find them funny is what I am saying

9/24/21, 21:19 - Tanushree: Like it's barely noticeable
9/24/21, 21:19 - Ashwin: I earlier used to find people making fun of dark skin tone also offensive
9/24/21, 21:20 - Ashwin: But lately I have realized life too short to take offense like that
9/24/21, 21:20 - Tanushree: I think things are only funny if you don't overdo them
9/24/21, 21:20 - Tanushree: If 5 jokes a day of yours is about me being fat, imma take offense
9/24/21, 21:20 - Ashwin: I am just  a patient patron

9/24/21, 21:22 - Tanushree: I was just giving an example 😂😂
9/24/21, 21:22 - Tanushree: If someone makes too many fat jokes
9/24/21, 21:22 - Ashwin: Okay okay
9/24/21, 21:22 - Tanushree: After a while I get pissed
9/24/21, 21:22 - Ashwin: Let me quit while I am ahead

9/25/21, 10:16 - Ashwin: Besides the point
9/25/21, 10:18 - Tanushree: No
9/25/21, 10:19 - Tanushree: 3 recommendations are needed
9/25/21, 10:19 - Tanushree: And sadly we have only 3 professors and one professor moved to iitk when I come to second year
9/25/21, 10:19 - Tanushree: So one is saying he is unsure. My supervisor will toh give only

9/25/21, 11:57 - Ashwin: Robin and Ted should be together
9/25/21, 11:57 - Tanushree: Found them incompatible kaafi
9/25/21, 11:57 - Tanushree: Robin is too ambitious for Ted to handle 😂
9/25/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: Hmm okay
9/25/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: The series has ended right?
9/25/21, 11:58 - Tanushree: Yuppo
9/25/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: That's a common plot point
9/25/21, 11:59 - Ashwin: In long running series
9/25/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: But Ted is too stubborn to understand
9/25/21, 11:59 - Ashwin: I don't know 😂
9/25/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: Took him long 😂
9/25/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: It's okayy
9/25/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: Robin ended up alone I guess
9/25/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: Travelling
9/25/21, 11:59 - Ashwin: Thanks for the spoilers
9/25/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: Nahi
9/25/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: She ends up with Barney
9/25/21, 12:00 - Ashwin: I thought barney might reform and end up with robin
9/25/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: Now that's a spoiler

9/25/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: I thought that was somewhere in mid
9/25/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: And they break up too
9/25/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: But okay, they didn't wanna make Robin look like a bitch
9/25/21, 12:01 - Ashwin: The vagrant womanizer reforming through the pangs of true love that is also a common plot point
9/25/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: But true, he can handle Robin better
9/25/21, 12:01 - Ashwin: He could apparently handle anything
9/25/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: 😂😂
Never happened with Joey tho
9/25/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: I know right? 😂😂
9/25/21, 12:01 - Ashwin: What did barney do as his day job
9/25/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: Joey wasn't a womanizer
9/25/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: God knows
9/25/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: 😂
9/25/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: He was too sweet
9/25/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: Joey was plain irritating
9/25/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: That's controversial
9/25/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: Of course
9/25/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: Imma have to take it outside
9/25/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: That's subjective 😂
9/25/21, 12:03 - Ashwin: Someone who like food and girls and is Italian
9/25/21, 12:03 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂

9/25/21, 12:05 - Ashwin: Ohh

9/25/21, 12:05 - Tanushree: 😂😂
9/25/21, 12:05 - Ashwin: But was he the scientist
9/25/21, 12:05 - Tanushree: No no
9/25/21, 12:05 - Tanushree: The scientist guy and Mike had a face off
9/25/21, 12:05 - Tanushree: When scientist proposed fisrt and pheobe said yes 😂😂😂😂
9/25/21, 12:05 - Ashwin: Okay Paul rudd is that guy in every romantic movie
9/25/21, 12:05 - Tanushree: Yess cutieeeeee
9/25/21, 12:06 - Ashwin: Now people can actually dual over phoebe, that's acceptable
9/25/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: That was hard to see 😂😂😂
9/25/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: Like that was such a clear choice
9/25/21, 12:06 - Ashwin: I know
9/25/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: David left her for Minsk 😂
9/25/21, 12:06 - Ashwin: The scientist was so good
9/25/21, 12:06 - Ashwin: And memorable
9/25/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: Abhi toh you said you didn't like him
9/25/21, 12:07 - Ashwin: I thought you were saying about the tall guy from how I met your mother
9/25/21, 12:07 - Tanushree: No no no
9/25/21, 12:07 - Tanushree: Although yes he was amazing too. Exactly my type of guy 😂
9/25/21, 12:07 - Ashwin: But that's what happens when you talk about two different series
9/25/21, 12:07 - Tanushree: Lekin
9/25/21, 12:07 - Tanushree: He is most
9/25/21, 12:07 - Ashwin: Ohh 🤩

9/25/21, 12:09 - Tanushree: Like not my favorite
9/25/21, 12:09 - Tanushree: But bearable
9/25/21, 12:09 - Ashwin: Hmm maybe you matured
9/25/21, 12:09 - Tanushree: Chandler ki bad qualities kya thi? Criticising and judging women? 😂😂
9/25/21, 12:09 - Ashwin: Maybe you regressed
9/25/21, 12:10 - Ashwin: Being edgy and having  a confused irritated air. And making jokes with a superior highbrow
9/25/21, 12:10 - Tanushree: Maybe I stopped like Ross after he constantly tried to keep Rachel when Emily wasn't comfortable
9/25/21, 12:10 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
9/25/21, 12:11 - Tanushree: But not judging and criticising women?
9/25/21, 12:11 - Ashwin: Who is Emily

9/25/21, 12:11 - Tanushree: You haven't seen any show thik se?

9/25/21, 12:11 - Tanushree: When he said Rachel during their ceremoney
9/25/21, 12:12 - Tanushree: He never married anyone black
9/25/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: Oh okay
9/25/21, 12:12 - Tanushree: Yaa so she basically stayed married
9/25/21, 12:12 - Tanushree: But she wanted to cut off Rachel
9/25/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: I like how you say that. Because apparently he married many people
9/25/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: Understood
9/25/21, 12:12 - Tanushree: 3 only 😂
Lesbian, Emily and Rachel.
9/25/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: That's natural

9/25/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: Rachel I'm Las vegas
9/25/21, 12:13 - Ashwin: That I know!
9/25/21, 12:13 - Tanushree: But idk everyone of them was hell bent on making her the villian
9/25/21, 12:13 - Tanushree: That's when I stopped liking Ross 😂😂😂

9/25/21, 12:13 - Tanushree: I don't even like it when people say they don't like the show
9/25/21, 12:13 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
9/25/21, 12:14 - Ashwin: Gags keep rolling one after the other
9/25/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: Yess
9/25/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: It's just easy 😂
9/25/21, 12:14 - Ashwin: It has a heart
9/25/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: There is barely anything I can watch twice
9/25/21, 12:14 - Ashwin: But mostly it's convenient
9/25/21, 12:14 - Ashwin: Relaxing
9/25/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: Yes
9/25/21, 12:14 - Ashwin: If the shows plot is all that you go for, then you can't
9/25/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: And everyone is hot
9/25/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: 😂😂
9/25/21, 12:15 - Tanushree: Idk why people say Chandler isn't hot

9/25/21, 12:15 - Tanushree: 🤮 Rachel is
9/25/21, 12:15 - Ashwin: But I never liked rachel
9/25/21, 12:15 - Ashwin: Cognitive dissonance?
9/25/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: My friends said I'm like Rachel
9/25/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: And idk
9/25/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: I was pissed

9/25/21, 12:16 - Ashwin: Because Rachel is many things
9/25/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: Dressing sense
9/25/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: Like you said
9/25/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: 😂
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: But most characteristic of hers is the impulsiveness.
9/25/21, 12:17 - Tanushree: Who wasn't impulsive in the show?
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: So when you are in any group if you don't have competition in that dept then people are more likely tk keep you in that bracket
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Chandler
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Joey
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Phoebe
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Monica
9/25/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Ross
9/25/21, 12:18 - Tanushree: I'm for sure not Monica and Joey, am I?
9/25/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: They all might have been impulsive at different points In the show but that was not their definition  characteristic as the show projected
9/25/21, 12:18 - Tanushree: Rachel was also not impulsive as such. She was, idk a bitch?
9/25/21, 12:19 - Ashwin: Are you a control freak ? You are a foodie like Joey and flirtatious
9/25/21, 12:19 - Tanushree: Haww
9/25/21, 12:19 - Ashwin: So yeah maybe you are Joey too
9/25/21, 12:19 - Ashwin: 😂😂

9/25/21, 12:20 - Tanushree: Still
9/25/21, 12:20 - Ashwin: And we as human beings like to group similar people together
9/25/21, 12:20 - Tanushree: You would choose someone you are very close to na
9/25/21, 12:20 - Ashwin: So we just some to make order out of chaos go for the most dominant trait and put I the basket

9/25/21, 12:21 - Tanushree: In general people opt for the closet option na.
9/25/21, 12:21 - Ashwin: Nhi in your group since they had made up their mind to map all of your traits with the fictional characters of friends you were the most ideal candidate
9/25/21, 12:22 - Tanushree: Nahi

9/25/21, 22:03 - Tanushree: Doing 😂
9/25/21, 22:04 - Tanushree: I think not as lazy as I look. I guess I have some random vitamin deficiency.
9/25/21, 22:05 - Tanushree: Raat ko I slept 8 hrs but din me again I slept for 8 hrs. Idk how am I sleeping so much
9/25/21, 22:05 - Tanushree: I barely did anything the whole day. Had to study
9/25/21, 23:21 - Ashwin: Sometimes somedays be like that
9/25/21, 23:22 - Tanushree: I'm staying home too much
9/25/21, 23:22 - Tanushree: But I have nowhere to go.
9/25/21, 23:22 - Tanushree: I think I should go back now. Atleast I used to go to lab
9/25/21, 23:23 - Ashwin: Okay
9/25/21, 23:24 - Tanushree: Okay

9/26/21, 11:04 - Ashwin: You'll like more like a professor
9/26/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: Is that a yes or a no?
9/26/21, 11:13 - Tanushree: This message was deleted
9/26/21, 11:40 - Ashwin: Yes(?)
9/26/21, 11:42 - Ashwin: Maybe also try rectangular frames
9/26/21, 11:45 - Tanushree: No extreme but okay will see😂😂
9/26/21, 13:58 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
9/26/21, 14:08 - Ashwin: I knew that infosys was giving dividend in Oct, I bought it with other stocks.
9/26/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: However chasing dividends may not be best strategy for swing traders like you
9/26/21, 14:23 - Tanushree: I don't chase dividend, I chase the high 😂
9/26/21, 14:23 - Tanushree: Warna I know stable stocks like Infosys, reliance, (Asian paints😂), will go up.
9/26/21, 14:48 - Ashwin: Okay 🤣
9/26/21, 14:50 - Tanushree: But seriously, I was showing the way he has written 😂
9/26/21, 14:50 - Tanushree: Galti se crore pati ban jaoge 😂😂
9/26/21, 14:51 - Ashwin: 😂😂
9/26/21, 14:51 - Ashwin: You deleted this message
9/26/21, 14:52 - Ashwin: Finally youtube is mainstream for hindi users
9/26/21, 14:58 - Tanushree: Stop deleting stuffff
9/26/21, 14:58 - Tanushree: 😐
9/26/21, 15:00 - Ashwin: It was a typi
9/26/21, 15:00 - Ashwin: O
9/26/21, 15:00 - Tanushree: Okay phir thik hai
9/26/21, 15:31 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/vaIH5tLmC8U
9/26/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: This experiment has been done before right, with steel monkey even
9/26/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: But this is really touching
9/26/21, 16:40 - Tanushree: I don't know really. Shayad kiya ho
9/26/21, 16:40 - Tanushree: Mere feed me aaya tha bas
9/26/21, 16:40 - Tanushree: Pata ni ku aajtak animals la bada aara 😂
9/26/21, 16:41 - Ashwin: https://youtu.be/OrNBEhzjg8I
9/26/21, 16:42 - Ashwin: Maybe animal brain and stocks have some algorithmic relationship
9/26/21, 17:37 - Tanushree: Oh right. This was more about the human need to attachment and man this study was so inhuman it was crazy.
9/26/21, 17:59 - Ashwin: I heard about this study in two different lectures from different universities. It was supposed to be a landmark study
9/26/21, 18:00 - Ashwin: Inhuman is an interesting word to use.
9/26/21, 18:21 - Tanushree: It was landmark study. But that is also bcoz there was no ethical grounding. The poor monkeys never learned to live normal. And they even forced pregnancies to see if dysfunctional monkeys can raise normal.
9/26/21, 18:21 - Tanushree: But ya, the study did tell alot out our attachment styles 👻
9/26/21, 18:25 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/52pAW3hRNIo wanna be rich enough to afford it 😂😂
9/26/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: I guess human are the only species who tend to humanize species other than themselves.
9/26/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: Monkeys are our close relatives though
9/26/21, 18:34 - Ashwin: Hmm does seem "inhuman"
9/26/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: That how we use our frontal lobe for moral decision making. Otherwise what's the point?
9/26/21, 18:36 - Ashwin: Ohhio is hello in Japanese. Only Japanese can come up with innovative trinkets like these for everyday use
9/26/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: Wese when there werent ethical considerations, scientists even harassed little children so don't let me get ahead of myself 😂😂
I'm a hypocrite. I kill ants all the time
9/26/21, 18:37 - Tanushree: Would love doing my PhD there but I have heard they are pretty sexist 😂😂
9/26/21, 18:37 - Ashwin: And you don't seem scandalized when they experiment on the mouse for neurological experiments 😂
9/26/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: I used to. But then meko yahi laga na, ki we do it all the time. How does it matter if it's an ant or an elephant
9/26/21, 18:38 - Ashwin: I do t know.. maybe survival of the species? That's the whole point. Human are so smug in their chances of survival that they can afford to sponsor other species.
9/26/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: Haan true. If we were in wars, we won't fuss over animals so much 😂😂
9/26/21, 18:39 - Ashwin: They would use the word traditional. It's so ingrained that women don't complain.
9/26/21, 18:39 - Ashwin: True
9/26/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: Haan but I'm not so traditional to be there 😂 but would love to visit.
9/26/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: How are you doing these days? Anything fun?
9/26/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: Everyone loves bring a tourist :)
9/26/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Exactly 🤩 Warna with the privileges I have, india is awesome too 😂😂
9/26/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: We have been corresponding rather constantly for this question 😂
9/26/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: I would love heard something fun tho 😂
9/26/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: You can watch squids game on Netflix. I watched a series after a long time. That's all.
9/26/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Name ajeeb hai 😂
9/26/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Will consider
9/26/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: I'm not watching things lately
9/26/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Working on my proposal
9/26/21, 18:43 - Ashwin: Okay 👌
9/26/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: 😬
9/27/21, 08:43 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/fWh3qCxxbW0 wow I literally didn't understand anything he said 😂 am I getting dumb or he is getting more complex
9/27/21, 09:02 - Ashwin: I'll check
9/27/21, 10:05 - Tanushree: Infosys fell. I bought again 👻
9/27/21, 11:07 - Ashwin: 👍
9/27/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: What he is saying is that. Young people are not having sex as much as they had. It's because the good ones are taken.and you are left with those on tinder. 

This not having sex is then contradicted as he goes on a tangent that apps like tinder and quick sex trains people to look for depraved relationships where cost of sex is zero. 

Then he proceeds to list out the things bad things about sex without romance.
9/27/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: Maybe the subtitles made it difficult to understand what he said
9/27/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: Maybe what he said and what I felt were not matching to meko samjh ni aaya
9/27/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: Esa laga jese kuch bohot complex bol gaya wo 😂 starting k 4-5 min
9/27/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: Yeah he contradicted himself 😅
9/27/21, 14:21 - Tanushree: I used to think about such things alot when I was single. Kuki tab option tha. 
Ab toh the debate is thoda futile. 
Jisko jo karna h karlo 😂 bas experience bataana kesa raha
9/27/21, 14:21 - Tanushree: Sumedha ayi hospital se wapas?
9/27/21, 14:22 - Tanushree: Idk I feel called her by name 😂 didi bolna zada apt lagta.
9/27/21, 16:01 - Ashwin: Yeah she has recovered!
9/27/21, 16:01 - Ashwin: She is just 23 😂
9/27/21, 16:01 - Ashwin: You are a didi to her
9/27/21, 16:02 - Ashwin: There are lot of "futile" things you think about. People who are single then should never think about relationships.
9/27/21, 16:19 - Tanushree: Phir sahi h 😂
Its weird calling older people by name 😂
9/27/21, 16:20 - Tanushree: Seems futile. I didn't say "are" futile.
Bas ab sochti ni me itna uspe over time
9/27/21, 17:55 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
9/27/21, 18:06 - Ashwin: He retweets actual paper release of others and tweets fake paper release of himself
9/27/21, 18:06 - Ashwin: Okay hmm
9/27/21, 18:06 - Ashwin: 😂😂
9/27/21, 18:13 - Tanushree: True 😂😂😂
9/27/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: https://youtube.com/shorts/zaAAoIJJLVc?feature=share french lesson
9/27/21, 19:03 - Ashwin: https://youtube.com/shorts/hDy9bLzgS8s?feature=share
9/27/21, 19:04 - Ashwin: Hmm language is weird
9/27/21, 19:15 - Tanushree: Are we getting Sam shorts 😂😂
9/27/21, 19:16 - Tanushree: Kal hi dekha mene. And it's cool how he gets money for doing what people day
9/27/21, 20:53 - Ashwin: Would you trade your freedom for money?
9/27/21, 20:53 - Ashwin: Now that's a thought experiment
9/27/21, 20:55 - Tanushree: Is that a temporary proposition?
9/27/21, 20:55 - Tanushree: Yes
9/27/21, 22:29 - Ashwin: We do this everyday though. Whenever you are listening to your teacher without telling her your mind you are basically sacrificing your freedom for value.
9/27/21, 22:29 - Ashwin: It would be more interesting to be more specific
9/27/21, 22:30 - Ashwin: Would you be a slave in exchange of money. I mean not a metaphorical one, the real deal
9/27/21, 22:31 - Ashwin: Temporal discussions aside
9/27/21, 22:59 - Ashwin: ask google to tell you a dirty joke
9/28/21, 05:06 - Tanushree: Slave for money as in? You are also a slave for money. I would be okayy too
9/28/21, 05:06 - Tanushree: I mean of course if you say ki coal mine me kaam karna hoga toh my body cant take that na? 😂
9/28/21, 05:06 - Tanushree: But if you just found me in a dumpster and took me home as a slave, I guess ya. So much better than living in a dumpster na? 😂 (Metaphorically)
9/28/21, 05:06 - Tanushree: Now as a slave if I have to cook, clean, take care of the children, drive around, not sleep on time, not being able to go out etc.
I guess that can sound like a slave? And some of the things my body can actually learn to do?
9/28/21, 05:06 - Tanushree: Kal karti 😂
9/28/21, 05:26 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/JIxPv3_RdOo this is sooo cute 😭😭❤️
9/28/21, 06:04 - Tanushree: https://staff.washington.edu/eloftus/Articles/sciam.htm read it if you get time.
9/28/21, 08:01 - Ashwin: You make it seem at worst a servant and at best a wife
9/28/21, 08:02 - Ashwin: I think being a slave would be much harder than that 😂
9/28/21, 08:02 - Ashwin: But yeah good gusto to answer the question like thag
9/28/21, 08:06 - Ashwin: The way she speaks is very cute too
9/28/21, 08:08 - Ashwin: I've read about it. How a lady imagined that she had a harassment episode in childhood which was a repressed memory. This also comes up in lectures often
9/28/21, 08:11 - Tanushree: Wives can wish to not do the work, pay the maid instead, nag their husband, go meet their friends 👻
9/28/21, 08:11 - Tanushree: How tho?
9/28/21, 08:12 - Tanushree: Yesss 😬
9/28/21, 08:12 - Tanushree: Isn't it amazing how you just construct traumatic memories in lab without people knowing? 😂😂
9/28/21, 09:25 - Ashwin: A difficult question to answer with propriety
9/28/21, 09:25 - Ashwin: A lot of anime also has cute kids sounding like her
9/28/21, 09:26 - Ashwin: In lab? Out of vacuum!
9/28/21, 10:16 - Tanushree: Aree that's now how you make conversation 😂😂
9/28/21, 10:16 - Tanushree: 😂😂
9/28/21, 10:16 - Tanushree: Hypnosis, suggestive therapy, etc

9/30/21, 18:38 - Ashwin: And would be easier to work with
9/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: She uses what she understands 😂😂
9/30/21, 18:38 - Ashwin: Hmm that's a good rule to live by

9/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: She will confirm

9/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: Haan my senior said tha same
9/30/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: When I was starting with unity I was also considering other stiff, at that time unity was the best product. Things might have changed now
9/30/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Plus I have seen most professors using unity
9/30/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Unreal toh rarely dekha kisi ko
9/30/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: Hmm

9/30/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: I hate coding. It requires so much patience
9/30/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Well it's in top 3
9/30/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: The creative lot would say impatience fuels coding
9/30/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: Unreal is number 2
9/30/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Then I might be very patient it should hurt
9/30/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Did you check the top 5 list? 😂

10/1/21, 00:02 - Tanushree: He said that in the first line na 😂😂 don't do options. Or kya bolta
10/1/21, 00:04 - Tanushree: Associating more emotions to your daily experiences help you remember your life more bcoz memory is associated with arousal (how hyped the stimuli felt)
So some who feels less will remember their life events less
10/1/21, 00:05 - Tanushree: Who!?
10/1/21, 00:05 - Tanushree: I find her extra 😂
10/1/21, 00:14 - Ashwin: What a lovely thing to say

10/1/21, 00:19 - Tanushree: Idc if you meant something else. Thank you 😂😂
10/1/21, 00:19 - Tanushree: In no way its a high arousal event 😂
10/1/21, 00:20 - Tanushree: Remembering having coffee with your first gf maybe high arousal event since more emotion was involved 😂😂
10/1/21, 00:21 - Tanushree: If a guy is not emotional enough to consider having normal coffee and coffee on their first date as different, then he may have memory issues 😂
10/1/21, 00:30 - Ashwin: Positive response 👌
10/1/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: Now my heart breaks. So I have essentially mad e a checkpoint here of bad memory to return to whenever you tease me about gf

10/7/21, 23:23 - Tanushree: Or I'll diversify even more
10/7/21, 23:32 - Ashwin: I mean nothing in you. It's teaching me atleast the hard way not letting me shuffle my stocks around
10/7/21, 23:32 - Ashwin: Hmm good strategy
10/7/21, 23:33 - Tanushree: Your financial discipline is off the roof man. It's just a phase
10/7/21, 23:33 - Tanushree: It's teaching me not to be too optimistic if something is going constantly high 😂

10/9/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: But it's okay. It's not established as causal.
10/9/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: And I haven't read the actual paper. But when the association is too high, it's not coincidence.
10/9/21, 10:53 - Ashwin: Agreed. There may be more to it.
10/9/21, 10:53 - Ashwin: You should share the p values. Don't keep it with yourselves

10/10/21, 15:53 - Ashwin: But seriously tho
10/10/21, 15:54 - Ashwin: One of the lady officers mentioned something about the sooner you get married the better
10/10/21, 15:54 - Ashwin: I don't want to burst your bubble
10/10/21, 15:54 - Tanushree: Better how?
10/10/21, 15:54 - Ashwin: But they say people have problem conceiving as the age increases
10/10/21, 15:55 - Tanushree: Ivf

10/10/21, 15:56 - Ashwin: Yeah I am not helping you am I
10/10/21, 15:56 - Tanushree: Not at all 😂😂
10/10/21, 15:56 - Tanushree: Before Aman, I was such a commitment phobic 😂😂
10/10/21, 15:56 - Tanushree: I would meet a guy and next day I'll reject him 😂😂
10/10/21, 15:56 - Tanushree: And I still feel like that person sometimes 😂😂
10/10/21, 15:57 - Ashwin: (But its natural to have anxiety. And since you value marriage so much, you would freak out. It's not so easy)
10/10/21, 15:57 - Ashwin: It's okay to be that person even now
10/10/21, 15:58 - Tanushree: Hm
10/10/21, 15:58 - Tanushree: I'm just constantly thinking about what she said
10/10/21, 15:58 - Tanushree: The way she said it 😂
10/10/21, 15:58 - Tanushree: Ifk
10/10/21, 15:58 - Tanushree: Don't you freak out?
10/10/21, 15:58 - Tanushree: Remember you are 26 😋
10/10/21, 15:59 - Ashwin: I have put that question onto the back burner abhi. I dismiss it whenever it pops up.
10/10/21, 15:59 - Ashwin: I like my bubble
10/10/21, 15:59 - Tanushree: I'll be excited when it will happen tho 😍
10/10/21, 15:59 - Tanushree: Parents kya bolre?
10/10/21, 15:59 - Ashwin: I somehow feel I am not gonna be a good husband sort of guy
10/10/21, 16:00 - Tanushree: Why?
10/10/21, 16:00 - Ashwin: Parents are surprisingly quiet something about my horoscope has stopped me from getting married for atlrats one year
10/10/21, 16:00 - Ashwin: Finally something in astrology I am grateful for
10/10/21, 16:00 - Tanushree: Wow 😍
But shouldn't they start looking? 😂
10/10/21, 16:01 - Ashwin: Let sleeping dogs lie
10/10/21, 16:01 - Tanushree: 😂😂
10/10/21, 16:01 - Tanushree: Scary tho
10/10/21, 16:01 - Ashwin: Scary yes
10/10/21, 16:01 - Ashwin: But its natural
10/10/21, 16:02 - Tanushree: Fear or marriage?
10/10/21, 16:02 - Tanushree: 😂
10/10/21, 16:02 - Ashwin: As long as you don't want to be a perfectionist
10/10/21, 16:02 - Tanushree: I dont
10/10/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: Like marriage won't be perfect, issues will crop up, you might even find a better guy, but it's I guess about adjustment
10/10/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: If you can stifle yourself to adjust which you'll have to do marriage is okay
10/10/21, 16:03 - Tanushree: I mean
10/10/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: Both
10/10/21, 16:03 - Tanushree: Yes, I still do this
10/10/21, 16:03 - Tanushree: But
10/10/21, 16:04 - Tanushree: I'm scared of not having an exit door
10/10/21, 16:04 - Ashwin: That's a very cynical way to look at stuff
10/10/21, 16:04 - Tanushree: I don't want an exit door, but I really need to have the option
10/10/21, 16:04 - Ashwin: Yes
10/10/21, 16:04 - Ashwin: This is a valid fear. But now I think more than anytime else
10/10/21, 16:04 - Ashwin: It's easier
10/10/21, 16:05 - Ashwin: Though it's rough
10/10/21, 16:05 - Tanushree: Yes
10/10/21, 16:05 - Tanushree: Exactly why it's scary
10/10/21, 16:05 - Ashwin: I also think about that. It's a big investment
10/10/21, 16:05 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
10/10/21, 16:05 - Tanushree: Yaa
10/10/21, 16:05 - Ashwin: Talk to akshita about it transfer some of the dear to her
10/10/21, 16:05 - Tanushree: Arranged marriages are risky. But man, parents are hella supportive there
10/10/21, 16:06 - Tanushree: She is more of a commitment phobic than me 😂 but she is also more optimistic
10/10/21, 16:06 - Ashwin: People when they think they found the one, tend to think everything will go right
10/10/21, 16:06 - Ashwin: And that's an attitude you need actually
10/10/21, 16:06 - Ashwin: Then marriage may sound exciting even
10/10/21, 16:07 - Ashwin: Trueee
10/10/21, 16:07 - Tanushree: Exciting, but still fearful na?
10/10/21, 16:07 - Tanushree: Exciting things can be scary too
10/10/21, 16:07 - Ashwin: No but in your excitement you may not think or dwell over the bad stuff
10/10/21, 16:08 - Ashwin: I mean butterflies in stomach - yes, but anxiously watching feel good movies- no
10/10/21, 16:08 - Tanushree: Like when I think about PhD abroad, I'm super hyped. But what if the professor is an asshole, and I don't make friends, and the weather is too cold. And I get depressed?
10/10/21, 16:08 - Tanushree: Even tho that's what I want to do, it's still very scary
10/10/21, 16:08 - Tanushree: So
10/10/21, 16:08 - Tanushree: Marriage toh pata ni kitna excited me😂😂
10/10/21, 16:08 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
10/10/21, 16:08 - Tanushree: You are trying to be positive or what? 😂
10/10/21, 16:08 - Ashwin: This is  nice comparison
10/10/21, 16:09 - Ashwin: I don't feel positive at all. Like this past week no. But somehow whenever I catch myself feeling sad or something
10/10/21, 16:10 - Ashwin: I keep reminding myself ki why the am I feeling sorry for
10/10/21, 16:10 - Ashwin: And I guess slight depression is also necessary sometimes
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: Bcoz something is wrong!
10/10/21, 16:10 - Ashwin: You can't be goody goody everytime
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: Haan
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: But
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: It's not slight then
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: Jitna me excited rehti
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: Utna hi zada sad
10/10/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: 😂
10/10/21, 16:11 - Ashwin: 😂😂
10/10/21, 16:11 - Ashwin: Do you get sad too ? (What a monstrous ques)
10/10/21, 16:11 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
10/10/21, 16:11 - Tanushree: That gets too much to handle
10/10/21, 16:11 - Ashwin: Like you get sad for extended periods of time?
10/10/21, 16:11 - Tanushree: But luckily only Aman really knows 😂
10/10/21, 16:12 - Ashwin: If he knows and he still can handle you. I guess he is a keeper.
10/10/21, 16:12 - Tanushree: Not depressed depressed. 
But I get sad and then mix it with anxiety and panic attacks
10/10/21, 16:12 - Tanushree: Last year it was major. This year is going good so far 😂
10/10/21, 16:13 - Ashwin: Panic attack
10/10/21, 16:13 - Ashwin: Like real physical
10/10/21, 16:13 - Tanushree: I broke up then 😂
I'm not a keeper
10/10/21, 16:13 - Tanushree: Or kesa aata h?
10/10/21, 16:13 - Ashwin: Woah
10/10/21, 16:13 - Ashwin: I am not I your league in that dept then

10/10/21, 16:14 - Tanushree: Haan.
10/10/21, 16:14 - Ashwin: Do you why you got it
10/10/21, 16:14 - Tanushree: True
10/10/21, 16:14 - Tanushree: ?
10/10/21, 16:14 - Ashwin: Anxiety induced attack
10/10/21, 16:15 - Tanushree: I don't know actually
10/10/21, 16:15 - Tanushree: There was no reason
10/10/21, 16:15 - Tanushree: Sab mast hi tha
10/10/21, 16:15 - Tanushree: I couldn't find no reason
10/10/21, 16:15 - Tanushree: So I'll start looking for reason
10/10/21, 16:15 - Ashwin: Okay
10/10/21, 16:15 - Ashwin: I understand
10/10/21, 16:15 - Ashwin: Thoda
10/10/21, 16:16 - Ashwin: But last week
10/10/21, 16:16 - Ashwin: Randomly I remembered this quote " in midst of coldest harshest winter, I knew there was an invincible summer inside me"
10/10/21, 16:17 - Ashwin: I don't know who wrote it or where I read it from
10/10/21, 16:17 - Ashwin: Like it came to me naturally
10/10/21, 16:17 - Ashwin: But I am sure I read it somewhere
10/10/21, 16:18 - Ashwin: You were writing something
10/10/21, 16:18 - Tanushree: I was thinking to writing
10/10/21, 16:18 - Tanushree: But then you complete
10/10/21, 16:19 - Ashwin: Haha autocomplete at your service
10/10/21, 16:19 - Ashwin: And when I am depressed ( like just sad for no reason) it was fun noticing my habits
10/10/21, 16:19 - Ashwin: Especially when you have nothing to do at home
10/10/21, 16:20 - Tanushree: It's interesting you have habits to notice
10/10/21, 16:20 - Ashwin: Hmm did we veer into a rather serious territory here
10/10/21, 16:20 - Ashwin: With a normal whatsapp conversation
10/10/21, 16:20 - Ashwin: I wonder
10/10/21, 16:21 - Tanushree: Idk

10/10/21, 16:24 - Ashwin: But maybe a sadist
10/10/21, 16:24 - Ashwin: So I find happiness
10/10/21, 16:24 - Tanushree: Compensating by talking positive? 😂

My weakness and tiredness is due to Anemia and low vit D
10/11/21, 17:17 - Ashwin: 😨😨
10/11/21, 18:06 - Ashwin: Same logic with biocon
10/11/21, 18:07 - Ashwin: Maybe that's why you were looking so pale
10/11/21, 18:07 - Ashwin: But liss is 2.5k
10/11/21, 18:08 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
10/11/21, 18:08 - Tanushree: Don't remove them all. Remove a small amount, invest in a good stock

10/11/21, 18:14 - Ashwin: Then it could be better
10/11/21, 18:14 - Ashwin: Or it could be worse
10/11/21, 18:14 - Ashwin: Atleast there is suspense
10/11/21, 18:14 - Tanushree: Will ask doctor se 😂😂

10/11/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: TCS has a very large market cap
10/11/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Increase in their profit will not raise your money much
10/11/21, 18:47 - Tanushree: But decrease in their profit will also not influence your money much
10/11/21, 18:47 - Tanushree: Very stable stock
10/11/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: That's whybit makes sense to buy when chips are down
10/11/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: But what do I know
10/11/21, 18:47 - Tanushree: Happiest mind has small market cap. So your money will grow faster with their growth
10/11/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: You are the genius
10/11/21, 18:47 - Tanushree: And it has good profit history
10/11/21, 18:48 - Ashwin: Also risky

10/13/21, 04:10 - Ashwin: i have seen people my age going and picking up women at pubs like it was their business to do so
10/13/21, 04:11 - Ashwin: I feel i am still hiding behind self respect wala shield

10/13/21, 04:13 - Ashwin: its more like approaching
10/13/21, 04:13 - Tanushree: Picking up women is not derogatory. It's about choice.
10/13/21, 04:13 - Ashwin: whenever you use thing in conversation, its a tell tale sign of judgement 😂
10/13/21, 04:13 - Ashwin: yup

10/13/21, 04:15 - Tanushree: Approaching people randomly maybe something people do, that's not very respectful in my opinion
10/13/21, 04:15 - Tanushree: So for the judgemental view.
10/13/21, 04:15 - Ashwin: okay, yeah even somewhere in me i think the same.
10/13/21, 04:15 - Tanushree: What is love without pain?
10/13/21, 04:15 - Ashwin: its not about love no

10/15/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: Okay 🥸
10/15/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: I don't force myself to feel something

10/15/21, 18:49 - Ashwin: You know what to do
10/15/21, 18:49 - Ashwin: It might just be boredom
10/15/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: My mother doesn't feel such things will get me fat
10/15/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: So she kinda insists (way tooooo much)
10/15/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: 😂😂
10/15/21, 18:49 - Ashwin: 😂😂
10/15/21, 18:50 - Ashwin: Mummy toh aakhir tumhari h

10/15/21, 18:50 - Tanushree: Jab I was doing my study
10/15/21, 18:50 - Tanushree: Some of the ways to reduce over eating is to
10/15/21, 18:50 - Tanushree: Not get unhealthy food at home
10/15/21, 18:50 - Tanushree: Even if you get, keep them away from your sight
10/15/21, 18:50 - Tanushree: In opaque boxes
10/15/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: Or upstairs
10/15/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: I agree with this piece of common sense advice
10/15/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: Like make it harder to reach
10/15/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: And in my home, it's opposit 😂😂
10/15/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: That's why I don't buy anything
10/15/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: Mumy gets things bcoz, just in case
10/15/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: Then finish all the packaged food in 1 week 😂😂
10/15/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: All the things are kept on the shelf
10/15/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: There is nothing at my home too
10/15/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: Because
10/15/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Well, we are poor
10/15/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: Han sure
10/15/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: When you know all this
10/15/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: And have done a study in obesity
10/15/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: And you have problems of getting fatter
10/15/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: Just laziness is a poor reason to not put control
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: I'm not doing any of it na actually
10/15/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: Read : Problem with getting fatter
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: Gone 😂
10/15/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: 😂😂
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: My mother does it all
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: She goes shopping
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: She keeps things around
10/15/21, 18:53 - Tanushree: And
10/15/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: Since these are being done since childhood
10/15/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: Eating has become stimulus driven than goal driven
10/15/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: You don't eat bcoz you are Hungary, you eat bcoz something edible is kept around
10/15/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: Hungry*
10/15/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: And I don't even eat that much. But if you are offered 10 things (note: out of love), how long can you say no everyday?
10/15/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: When I'm staying alone in Allahabad, I don't buy anything packaged.
For rainy days, I have some hidden in shelf
10/15/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: But these things are done when you have some control over your settings
10/15/21, 18:56 - Ashwin: I want to say "Hey I didn't ask you to give me a thesis on eating behaviours at your home" but that will be untrue. Because, interesting study.
10/15/21, 18:56 - Ashwin: How I deal with this is my first response to anything mom gives is no
10/15/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: And then I would eat a little grudgingly
10/15/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: She would not insist the same next time
10/15/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: Interesting
10/15/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: Even though she tries lovely soul
10/15/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: That doesn't happen
10/15/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: But that just reinforcement learning in practice
10/15/21, 18:58 - Tanushree: Okay
10/15/21, 19:30 - Ashwin: Kay

10/16/21, 06:28 - Tanushree: It was such an amazing show 😍
10/16/21, 06:48 - Ashwin: Trident isn't a retailer primarily right? It's supposed to a cotton spinning company one of its offshoot is now retail. But with the amount of money inflow it might grow nicely
10/16/21, 06:48 - Tanushree: No no retail also

10/25/21, 13:24 - Ashwin: The big whales get out of saturated sectors to less saturated ones. Like he mentioned instead of it they'll be going to banking next

10/29/21, 09:37 - Ashwin: What does it mean

10/29/21, 09:56 - Tanushree: It go even more down
10/29/21, 09:56 - Tanushree: No no. I don't have the stocks in my account

10/29/21, 09:56 - Ashwin: Ahh you sold it before
10/29/21, 09:57 - Ashwin: Accha
10/29/21, 09:57 - Tanushree: It's already 20% down
10/29/21, 09:57 - Ashwin: So right now you have 1 stock?
10/29/21, 09:57 - Tanushree: I have 5. But I can't sell them
10/29/21, 09:57 - Tanushree: Bcoz not in my account

10/29/21, 09:58 - Ashwin: But that's okay I guess
10/29/21, 09:58 - Tanushree: How much in irctc
10/29/21, 09:59 - Ashwin: When yesterday stock prices were coming down it should have given a hint. I guess some big traders get tip on such decision far more easily
10/29/21, 10:00 - Ashwin: That's why stocks like irctc are pretty risky. Since it's based on policy, people aware of policy are able to predict it much more easily, and retail investors are more reactive more than anything else
10/29/21, 10:01 - Tanushree: Haan, but ye chize dekhke pata ni lagti na. I thought it's fluctuating after split

11/1/21, 18:33 - Tanushree: 😂
11/1/21, 18:33 - Tanushree: Which story you liked the most?
11/1/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: I liked Rebecca's story best
11/1/21, 18:34 - Ashwin: Second was the disembodied woman for wow factor
11/1/21, 18:34 - Ashwin: Rest of the clients were aged with some exceptions the tic and twins
11/1/21, 18:34 - Ashwin: But how suddenly it happens to a young woman was shocking
11/1/21, 18:34 - Ashwin: Rebecca's story was warm
11/1/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: Let me google what rebecca had 😂
11/1/21, 18:39 - Ashwin: Rebecca's story was different
11/1/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: I loved that mariners story. Who lost his ability to make memories. Having no sense of today and tomorrow, he found meaning ❤️
11/1/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: Dekhti
11/1/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: She was taken to be completely an idiot but was able to make deep attachments
11/1/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Haan gotcha. The one who couldn't co ordinate her body
11/1/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: And the guy who drew sketches
11/1/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: Except while dancing
11/1/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Ummmmm...

11/1/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Let me google what disorder he had 😂
11/1/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: You could see the drawing improve
11/1/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Ohhh okayy
11/1/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Autism

11/1/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Hopeful*
11/1/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: He harped on about how people see the deficits but not the other part in which they are extraordinary
11/1/21, 18:43 - Ashwin: Helpful*
11/1/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: Haan

11/1/21, 18:43 - Ashwin: Which is corny but genuine
11/1/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: I liked how he stuck with how you lose something soooo essential, and still you find ways to go on
11/1/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: Haan.
11/1/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: Yeah
11/1/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: And I was not even aware

11/1/21, 18:44 - Tanushree: Yes
11/1/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: There was one chapter of how spinal fluid changes after syphilis makes you horny
11/1/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: Our two senses no one cares about 🥺
11/1/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: Loved the story 😂😂
11/1/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: My mind was blown on several counts
11/1/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: Yeahh
11/1/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: 1. Syphilis virus evolves so that people become more horny.

2. How a little meddling with fluid in your spine can cause such a large physiological change
11/1/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: 1. For transmission
11/1/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: 😂😂

11/12/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: Hmm
11/12/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: Interesting
11/12/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Day to day basis p
11/12/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: So no deep value
11/12/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: I don't feel you don't notice small things
11/12/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Including my fat
11/12/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: 🙂
11/12/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Face value ka opposite deep value hota?
11/12/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: I am not afraid to tell it to you
11/12/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: Because I know you will take it in same spirit
11/12/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: I have not seen your any other persona till now which you mentioned once like you take things to heart and cry
11/12/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: I do it with Aman only I guess
11/12/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Everything he says hurts me and I always overreact 😂
11/12/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: If I start doing with friends, maybe I'm afraid they will kick me out 😂
11/12/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: Okay so that us restricted to 'my males' club
11/12/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: 😂😂
11/12/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: Female also
11/12/21, 18:43 - Ashwin: Okay my males (females included) club
11/12/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: I asked saumya
11/12/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: The credit card thing
11/12/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: She said she keeps a track of expenses
11/12/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: So she doesn't think it's true
11/12/21, 18:44 - Tanushree: 😐
What will it take to shut you up? 🙂
11/12/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: Vip entry
11/12/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: This is true
11/12/21, 18:44 - Tanushree: Where?
11/12/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: Like it's easier to know about expenses
11/12/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: But I'll tell you how
11/12/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: Credit card company are playing around credit rating criteria
11/12/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: Like more you spend and return on time better credit score so better loans in future
11/12/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: This kind of makes you wanna use your credit card everywhere as you think it's giving you value additional to purchase
11/12/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: However you tend to buy things in bulk when using credit cars who pays 5 rs with it
11/12/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: So why do you use it when you know?
11/12/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: So if you go to buy biscuits you'll invariably buy milk and other things also thinking you wanna use credit card
11/12/21, 18:47 - Tanushree: We read about this in behavioural economics. But then asking people about their personal experience adds to my database 😂
11/12/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: The other thing is there are places where credit card is charged more for use by the merchant
11/12/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: But we still use it because of the credit score thing
11/12/21, 18:47 - Ashwin: It's just a very strong imposing narrative that's all
11/12/21, 18:48 - Ashwin: (Plus a large audience goes behind lounge rewards etc are separate)
11/12/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: Yaaa
11/12/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: I won't know unless I personally have
11/12/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: But I used to spend a bit more when I switched from cash to gpay 😂
I always knew I have money, so thoda badh gaya tha street food wala expense
11/12/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: So I felt it might work for others too
11/12/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: It does
11/12/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: To the my males (females included club)
11/12/21, 18:54 - Ashwin: Are you writing a thesis

11/12/21, 20:29 - Tanushree: I'm in my domain
11/12/21, 20:29 - Tanushree: That's why I know 😂😂
11/12/21, 20:29 - Ashwin: Like really a niche
11/12/21, 20:29 - Ashwin: If you are then you'll not feel this
11/12/21, 20:29 - Ashwin: Shouldnt*
11/12/21, 20:30 - Tanushree: I think I'm going fine for myself
11/12/21, 20:30 - Tanushree: But still very frequently people ask na
11/12/21, 20:30 - Tanushree: Job ni karna? Paisa ni kamana? 😂
11/12/21, 20:30 - Tanushree: I feel I won't be going very good in that department
11/12/21, 20:37 - Ashwin: Okay.
11/12/21, 20:37 - Ashwin: Success need be paisa
11/12/21, 20:37 - Ashwin: You could be a world famous researcher
11/12/21, 20:37 - Ashwin: Etc.
11/12/21, 20:37 - Ashwin: Paisa will follow
11/12/21, 20:38 - Ashwin: What is success for you
11/12/21, 20:38 - Ashwin: Such kind of talks can only happen on text or face ti face I feel
11/12/21, 20:38 - Ashwin: Side note
11/12/21, 20:38 - Ashwin: One would feel silly asking this over call
11/12/21, 20:38 - Ashwin: Or am I yet to have such a call?
11/12/21, 20:45 - Tanushree: Well I don't value fame so much
11/12/21, 20:45 - Tanushree: I'm in long distance. Everything happens on texts so I'm experienced 😂
11/12/21, 20:46 - Tanushree: Well I'm content with what I have write now. But I think I tend to compare with my closer friends, mostly bcoz I have to keep up with them
11/12/21, 20:47 - Tanushree: Like just recently, my friends are making plans for Thailand trip 😂
So such things they can do spontaneously, I have to save for months to go local.
11/12/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: So success ka koi as such definition ni hai. I just want to keep up with my close friends right now without struggle.
11/12/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: I barely meet them anymore. So whenever I meet, I don't want to feel conscious about money
11/12/21, 20:49 - Tanushree: I'm fine now also, except I'm not used to being so conscious about my expenses.
11/12/21, 20:49 - Ashwin: Close friends kon h

11/12/21, 21:03 - Ashwin: sometimes while conversing I am like my father
11/12/21, 21:03 - Ashwin: Ill speak too the point very polite very eloquent
11/12/21, 21:03 - Ashwin: like sitting in mess talking to a senior
11/12/21, 21:03 - Ashwin: I am witty or I tend to believe
11/12/21, 21:03 - Ashwin: that too angreji mein
11/12/21, 21:04 - Ashwin: but sometimes
11/12/21, 21:04 - Ashwin: I find myself looking for something to talk about
11/12/21, 21:04 - Tanushree: Hmmmm
11/12/21, 21:04 - Ashwin: well not really something something clever or funny, because I dont like to talk much aise hi
11/12/21, 21:04 - Tanushree: So you steal lines from books?
11/12/21, 21:04 - Ashwin: I like to listen
11/12/21, 21:04 - Ashwin: I dont
11/12/21, 21:05 - Ashwin: more often than not Ill say something random
11/12/21, 21:05 - Tanushree: Ohhhhh
11/12/21, 21:05 - Ashwin: and so that people dont feel I am completely off my rockers I lend a thin veil of credibility by saying its from a book
11/12/21, 21:05 - Ashwin: like I have never read atomic habits
11/12/21, 21:05 - Ashwin: sure I know what the books about
11/12/21, 21:05 - Ashwin: I know the philosophy
11/12/21, 21:06 - Ashwin: but that day when you asked is it from that book ? I thought okay lets just agree
11/12/21, 21:06 - Ashwin: yeah its from that book
11/12/21, 21:06 - Ashwin: so
11/12/21, 21:06 - Tanushree: So you try to sum that up? 🐒
11/12/21, 21:06 - Ashwin: I was very bad at maths ever since I was a toddler
11/12/21, 21:06 - Ashwin: so my sums would never add up
11/12/21, 21:06 - Tanushree: You thoughts let's agree?
11/12/21, 21:07 - Ashwin: rather I tend to make a sentence on the fly that may not really be leak proof as in there would be holes in the logic
11/12/21, 21:07 - Tanushree: But were you really bad?
11/12/21, 21:07 - Tanushree: 😂
11/12/21, 21:07 - Ashwin: I would see the flaws and would feel underconfident about what I said
11/12/21, 21:07 - Ashwin: yeah I think thats what happens
11/12/21, 21:08 - Ashwin: yes agreeing is a nice way to move conversation forward
11/12/21, 21:08 - Tanushree: Achaa
11/12/21, 21:08 - Ashwin: though not too agreeable
11/12/21, 21:08 - Tanushree: So you don't think much before saying is what you wanna say?
11/12/21, 21:08 - Ashwin: I was. Youll finda  small nishan on left side of my forehead.
11/12/21, 21:08 - Ashwin: i owe that to poor grades in maths
11/12/21, 21:08 - Ashwin: ITs complicated

11/12/21, 21:12 - Tanushree: Will go somewhere else also
11/12/21, 21:12 - Ashwin: so it will be perfect after you get cataract
11/12/21, 21:12 - Ashwin: i think thickness would imporove

11/12/21, 21:34 - Tanushree: Even for 1%
11/12/21, 21:34 - Tanushree: It's as much as 9%
11/12/21, 21:34 - Ashwin: like how does that work out
11/12/21, 21:34 - Tanushree: 9% less money you'll get in the end
11/12/21, 21:35 - Tanushree: I just watched a video
11/12/21, 21:35 - Tanushree: I was trying to understand
11/12/21, 21:35 - Tanushree: How expense ratios are calculated
11/12/21, 21:35 - Tanushree: Like on the whole capital, or just the profit
11/12/21, 21:35 - Ashwin: okay
11/12/21, 21:36 - Ashwin: but how does that 1 % convert to 9%
11/12/21, 21:35 - Tanushree: So just for reference, I watched a video
11/12/21, 21:36 - Tanushree: And thoda khud se kiya roughly
11/12/21, 21:36 - Tanushree: So it's coming out kafi zada
11/12/21, 21:36 - Tanushree: 1% is getting deducted each year no
11/12/21, 21:36 - Tanushree: And if that happens every year, it will keep increasing
11/12/21, 21:36 - Tanushree: And I'm just talking about one time investment
11/12/21, 21:37 - Tanushree: Like if you invest 1lakh and forget and take out 10 years later
11/12/21, 21:37 - Ashwin: woah
11/12/21, 21:37 - Ashwin: okay
11/12/21, 21:37 - Tanushree: But for sips, it's alooooot more😐
11/12/21, 21:37 - Tanushree: This was shocking
11/12/21, 21:37 - Tanushree: So I'm bracing myself for this
11/12/21, 21:38 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/Ofpg8h2h0vA I will be doing this manually too
11/12/21, 21:38 - Tanushree: Bas samjh rahi rhi. In case you want reference
11/12/21, 21:38 - Ashwin: okay
11/12/21, 21:38 - Ashwin: hmm
11/12/21, 21:38 - Tanushree: Also, mutual funds for 3-4 years is pretty useless. It's advices you put money for 6-7 years atleast
11/12/21, 21:39 - Tanushree: That's how the negatives are averaged out
11/12/21, 21:39 - Tanushree: Initial 3-4 years, returns are not good. But market is not on highs all the time. 
But every so often, it's takes a huge leap, and that's when you make money
11/12/21, 21:40 - Ashwin: yeah
11/12/21, 21:40 - Ashwin: okay
11/12/21, 21:40 - Tanushree: But then
11/12/21, 21:40 - Tanushree: If you are not an expert
11/12/21, 21:40 - Tanushree: How will you invest anyway
11/12/21, 21:40 - Tanushree: So I guess that's the only option na?
11/12/21, 21:41 - Ashwin: the other option is looking at a smallcase
11/12/21, 21:41 - Ashwin: have you explored that
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: I have
11/12/21, 21:41 - Ashwin: does it also have an expense ratio
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: But they are not very actively managed
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: Yes they do
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: But they are usually less than 5%
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: Sorry
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: 1%
11/12/21, 21:41 - Tanushree: Se kam rehta
11/12/21, 21:41 - Ashwin: nor are mutual funds with small expense ratio
11/12/21, 21:41 - Ashwin: even in mutual funds its the same
11/12/21, 21:42 - Tanushree: Yes, but it's actively managed by experts
11/12/21, 21:42 - Ashwin: index funds you can get at expense ratio as low as .15
11/12/21, 21:42 - Ashwin: and the highest i had invested was 0.98 sbi before i stopped
11/12/21, 21:42 - Tanushree: Index funds small case wale, they are changed 3-4 times per year only
Sometimes even once per year
11/12/21, 21:43 - Ashwin: yes thats why
11/12/21, 21:43 - Ashwin: but as you have seen
11/12/21, 21:43 - Ashwin: expense ratio also kills
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: Wow
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: If one doesn't invest his own money
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: They will giving out alot na
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: Lekin option kya?
11/12/21, 21:43 - Ashwin: option is buying S&P
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: Especially since you are in government job
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: ORRRRRRR
11/12/21, 21:43 - Tanushree: I have an amazing idea

11/12/21, 21:44 - Ashwin: thats a good idea, worth considering
11/12/21, 21:44 - Ashwin: but what if she tries to optimise life after getting married
11/12/21, 21:44 - Ashwin: cut out loss making propositions, ergo the husband
11/12/21, 21:45 - Ashwin: or look at companies you want to inves tin long term or look at comanies mutual funds invest in and buy from zerodha directly
11/12/21, 21:45 - Ashwin: on dips

11/12/21, 21:47 - Tanushree: Yes it can be done. But you don't have so much time
11/12/21, 21:48 - Ashwin: I mean I can stop everything else and study this
11/12/21, 21:47 - Tanushree: Imma be investing my own money by god

11/13/21, 00:40 - Tanushree: That
11/13/21, 00:40 - Tanushree: I should stop talking for a while?
11/13/21, 00:41 - Ashwin: okay for most of fthe time i am at a loss of words so it feels nice when you shore up a conversation

11/13/21, 00:42 - Ashwin: why is this feeling abhi
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: Samne wale ka opinion is not same as mine
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: I do want them to do differently
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: I just wanna understand
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: Maybe
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: I offend people
11/13/21, 00:42 - Ashwin: yes some people might take offence
11/13/21, 00:42 - Ashwin: if you try to ungli them
11/13/21, 00:42 - Ashwin: 😂😂
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: I'm just trying to understand
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: Not like people can give a paragraph on a time and still be accurate
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: So I ask questions
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: Manyyy
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: And after a while
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: Too many
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: And
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: Now
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: I am getting conscious
11/13/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: but people might not take it that way, it might seem intrusive too
11/13/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: youll have to temper yourself
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: I do
11/13/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: to people
11/13/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: But then
11/13/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: I don't feel like talking to them
11/13/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: Bcoz I can't have a conversation
11/13/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: What's the point?
11/13/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: It's very hard to be with people I know little about
11/13/21, 00:44 - Ashwin: no it is still a conversation if you cant have your way
11/13/21, 00:44 - Ashwin: you just have to be tactful about it
11/13/21, 00:44 - Ashwin: its hard and also not so hard
11/13/21, 00:45 - Ashwin: like you dont need to intimately know each and every person
11/13/21, 00:45 - Tanushree: Not each and everyone
11/13/21, 00:45 - Ashwin: you dont need to remember which state they belong to
11/13/21, 00:45 - Tanushree: But atleast the close ones
11/13/21, 00:45 - Tanushree: I kinda do
11/13/21, 00:46 - Ashwin: yeah so for the close ones you can ask. You say people are close when you can be yourself with them.
11/13/21, 00:46 - Ashwin: if you cant then be at a safe distance and observe the tide
11/13/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: Not sure anymore
11/13/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: Like I didn't know this before
11/13/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: My friend Shivam? He said this
11/13/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: That I make him feel dumb
11/13/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: Bcoz I ask so many questions even he doesn't know about himself
11/13/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: How can he tell
11/13/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: it can be seen, based on how you take it
11/13/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: a very nice compliment
11/13/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: I have known him so 6-7 years now
11/13/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: still its johari window
11/13/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: And he said I make him feel like it
11/13/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: Hein?
11/13/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: the perspecctive another person might be able to give you is vastly differnt from your own
11/13/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: normally people arent so curious about you
11/13/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: but when somebody is curious enough they are bound to ask questions that you have no answer to
11/13/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: like the other day you wer asking about my relationship
11/13/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: i also dont know so i clammed up
11/13/21, 00:49 - Ashwin: everyone has a different way of dealing with things
11/13/21, 00:49 - Ashwin: if shivam was self assured before
11/13/21, 00:49 - Ashwin: you showed him ki there might be questions he didnt consider before
11/13/21, 00:49 - Ashwin: thats why he feels that way
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: Han
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: I guess
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: I didn't mean ro
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: I just wanted to know more
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: And
11/13/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: Idk
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: Tabse we have stopped talking
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: I don't want this
11/13/21, 00:50 - Ashwin: this was when
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: To happen to more people
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: I can sense it
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: With saumua
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: If I ask more types
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: Not personal
11/13/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: But normal also
11/13/21, 00:51 - Ashwin: okay why do you feel this just abhi did something happen
11/13/21, 00:51 - Tanushree: Yes
11/13/21, 00:51 - Tanushree: We were talking in a group
11/13/21, 00:51 - Tanushree: About how much sunscreen one should use
11/13/21, 00:51 - Tanushree: 3 fingers?
11/13/21, 00:51 - Tanushree: They said no they don't care so much
11/13/21, 00:51 - Ashwin: 😂😂
11/13/21, 00:51 - Tanushree: I said so many videos online saying to use 3 fingers
11/13/21, 00:52 - Ashwin: and then
11/13/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Then shankari sent a picture
11/13/21, 00:52 - Ashwin: okay
11/13/21, 00:53 - Ashwin: is your net having issues?
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: I was looking for this
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: So
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: This picture is stupid
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: How much is the diameter
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: And even if we assume the diameter
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: What is the thickness?
11/13/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: And what about the texture?
11/13/21, 00:54 - Ashwin: okay okay youve made your point
11/13/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: Liquid, cream, gel?
11/13/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: But then
11/13/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: I didn't ask aage
11/13/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: What is the point of 15 mins convo on sunscreen
11/13/21, 00:54 - Ashwin: then the three fingers analogy also wont serve the purpose
11/13/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: When I still couldn't ask
11/13/21, 00:54 - Ashwin: see
11/13/21, 00:54 - Ashwin: okay
11/13/21, 00:55 - Ashwin: the point was to get their opinion
11/13/21, 00:55 - Tanushree: The point was also to discuss
11/13/21, 00:55 - Tanushree: What could be done
11/13/21, 00:55 - Tanushree: Not just opinion
11/13/21, 00:55 - Ashwin: long back i said you only ask your freinds for a second opinion for advice you seek experts
11/13/21, 00:55 - Ashwin: so you did discuss
11/13/21, 00:55 - Ashwin: i find nothing wrong in the conversation
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: Haan
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: Then
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: I wanted to ask more
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: And
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: I didn't
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: And I felt
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: Weird
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: And
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: I often feel it
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: Bcoz
11/13/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: I can't ask enough
11/13/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: I always stop before I get what I wanna know, bcoz I feel it will be annoying
11/13/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: If it happens kabhi kabhi, it's okay
11/13/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: But it happens too often
11/13/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: Makes me uneasy about myself
11/13/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: :)
11/13/21, 00:57 - Ashwin: so you can sweetly ask guys am i annoying maybe or share a gif or a meme or a sticker
11/13/21, 00:57 - Ashwin: i get what you are trying to say
11/13/21, 00:58 - Ashwin: its a weird feeling to have with close friends
11/13/21, 00:58 - Ashwin: but sometimes its best to talk it out
11/13/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: I already ask this too often
11/13/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Am I annoying you?
11/13/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Did I hurt you?
11/13/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Now asking this will annoy them too after a while? 😂
11/13/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Not the point
11/13/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Just
11/13/21, 00:59 - Tanushree: I feel, I can never ask enough
11/13/21, 00:59 - Tanushree: I always wanna know more
11/13/21, 00:59 - Ashwin: okay
11/13/21, 00:59 - Ashwin: like always
11/13/21, 00:59 - Ashwin: you are never satisfied
11/13/21, 00:59 - Ashwin: ?
11/13/21, 00:59 - Tanushree: Without introducing double meaning, yes
11/13/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: Esa ni hai ki never
11/13/21, 01:00 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
11/13/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: I can talk to you, bcoz often I do feel okay
11/13/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: With Aman also
11/13/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: And taarif ni kari me
11/13/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: But it's not happening with many people now
11/13/21, 01:00 - Ashwin: that feeling that you may offend people
11/13/21, 01:01 - Ashwin: yeah it depends on people
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: Yes, if I ask more
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: I might
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: And
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: I often do
11/13/21, 01:01 - Ashwin: whom you are interacting with
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: Akshita shivam saumya have said it sometimes
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: So I do less
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: They are my closest friends
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: Either I'm losing touch
11/13/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: Or getting more annoying
11/13/21, 01:01 - Ashwin: No one way to look at it is
11/13/21, 01:01 - Ashwin: people will take offence for multiple reasons
11/13/21, 01:02 - Ashwin: me included sometimes its baffling and difficult to predict
11/13/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Yaar these people I know for yeaaaaaarssaa
11/13/21, 01:02 - Ashwin: now you are close to all these guys so well
11/13/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Saumya rehne dete, she wese bhi interacts less
11/13/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Akshita shivam, like soooo close
11/13/21, 01:02 - Ashwin: that you pick on cues when they get slighlty annoyed
11/13/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: And now I can't ask them things
11/13/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Well, idk
11/13/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Maybe
11/13/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: and then overthink
11/13/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: I do understand when someone is getting annoyed, they will start acting impatient
11/13/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: Like you do
11/13/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: When the conversation is going long and you gotta run
11/13/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
11/13/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: i make a show
11/13/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂

11/13/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: and its not like i dont like the conversation
11/13/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: And it's fine
11/13/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: It's not like I don't understand
11/13/21, 01:04 - Ashwin: its more because i actually have to run
11/13/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: I can ask later
11/13/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: But
11/13/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: I'm losing the touch
11/13/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: With soo soo many people

11/14/21, 21:53 - Ashwin: It's not bad
11/14/21, 21:53 - Ashwin: But

11/14/21, 21:54 - Ashwin: Hmm

11/14/21, 21:54 - Tanushree: My goals are PhD then getting funding for my own research 🙂
11/14/21, 21:54 - Ashwin: Admirable goal
11/14/21, 21:54 - Tanushree: I got your point 😂
11/14/21, 21:54 - Tanushree: But see
11/14/21, 21:54 - Ashwin: You do you
11/14/21, 21:54 - Tanushree: Mostly log itna ni sochte na
11/14/21, 21:54 - Tanushree: They want a job
11/14/21, 21:54 - Ashwin: (And aman)
11/14/21, 21:54 - Tanushree: Then they wanna settle
11/14/21, 21:55 - Tanushree: ☺️
11/14/21, 21:55 - Tanushree: So in that context only
11/14/21, 21:55 - Ashwin: Yeah
11/14/21, 21:55 - Ashwin: But that makes it sound like they wanna come here because they couldn't find better
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: Exactly
11/14/21, 21:56 - Ashwin: But there another breed of passionate people
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: That's why they joined na
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: 😂
11/14/21, 21:56 - Ashwin: Who come here thinking they'll serve and stuff
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: Haaaan
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: Wo alag variety k hote
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: They came there for the perksss
11/14/21, 21:56 - Tanushree: Free raashan 😂😂
11/14/21, 21:57 - Ashwin: Sometimes this lot is dissapointed when they see that it's not so easy as it seemed
11/14/21, 21:57 - Tanushree: Apko dekhke toh ni lagta disappointing 🐒
11/14/21, 21:58 - Ashwin: Some good natured people also come not knowing what to expect or having no other motives than maybe a misunderstanding or a trying their luck
11/14/21, 21:58 - Ashwin: These guys I think experience most change
11/14/21, 21:58 - Tanushree: Haan
11/14/21, 21:58 - Tanushree: Then they adjust
11/14/21, 21:59 - Ashwin: I am not dissapointed because I know that beneath all the veneer its a people run organization. And there is no place for individual heroics unless that's exactly your deployment
11/14/21, 21:59 - Ashwin: But theek h
11/14/21, 21:59 - Ashwin: I'll go snuggle with my brother
11/14/21, 21:59 - Ashwin: You are okay with kiwi for dinner
11/14/21, 21:59 - Ashwin: ?
11/14/21, 21:59 - Tanushree: Yaa

11/14/21, 21:59 - Tanushree: 🐒
11/14/21, 22:00 - Ashwin: Yeah :)
11/14/21, 22:00 - Tanushree: Gotcha. No one wanna die tho 🧐
11/14/21, 22:00 - Ashwin: Why would anyone in their right frame of mind want to die
11/14/21, 22:01 - Ashwin: So much resources and time wa spouted into your training
11/14/21, 22:01 - Ashwin: Why would I die
11/14/21, 22:01 - Tanushree: No
11/14/21, 22:01 - Ashwin: It would serve the nation better if I live and serve
11/14/21, 22:01 - Tanushree: If you can't be so heroic, you'll also not die
11/14/21, 22:01 - Tanushree: So win win
11/14/21, 22:01 - Tanushree: Perks toh milenge hi wese bhi
11/14/21, 22:01 - Tanushree: Focus ispe tha mera
11/14/21, 22:01 - Ashwin: Being hero doesn't mean you'll die. Life not always a tragedy
11/14/21, 22:02 - Tanushree: People join for the perks
11/14/21, 22:02 - Ashwin: They try hard to weed out people like these
11/14/21, 22:02 - Ashwin: But there are people who have hacked the system or go under radar
11/14/21, 22:02 - Tanushree: Usually us commeners associate being a soldier hero with near dead experiences you people have to face
11/14/21, 22:03 - Ashwin: And then there might be favoritism
11/14/21, 22:03 - Ashwin: Yeah because that's what bollywood feeds you with
11/14/21, 22:03 - Ashwin: And also good work is never praised
11/14/21, 22:03 - Ashwin: But its a good thing
11/14/21, 22:03 - Ashwin: People who have given up their lives need to be revered
11/14/21, 22:04 - Tanushree: That's not how normal people are evaluating heroism tho
11/14/21, 22:04 - Tanushree: I know stereotypical, but that's not what common people think or believe
11/14/21, 22:04 - Ashwin: Anyway I am heading for my cuddles only time I'll get this week
11/14/21, 22:04 - Tanushree: Bcoz this week is over 😂
11/14/21, 22:04 - Ashwin: If I had a gf
11/14/21, 22:04 - Ashwin: Things would be different
11/14/21, 22:05 - Ashwin: 😍
11/14/21, 22:05 - Tanushree: You'd be bored 😂😂
11/14/21, 22:05 - Tanushree: But sure
11/14/21, 22:05 - Tanushree: Enjoy
11/14/21, 22:05 - Ashwin: Yes. But trust me that's not what being a hero is. It's about doing your stuff and helping others.
11/14/21, 22:05 - Ashwin: Not at all. I can't imagine being boredddd
11/14/21, 22:05 - Tanushree: I'm not saying that at all 😂
11/14/21, 22:06 - Ashwin: I am saying it
11/14/21, 22:06 - Tanushree: This message was deleted

11/15/21, 07:32 - Ashwin: i tried searching here nhi mila
11/15/21, 07:34 - Ashwin: image brightness etc
11/15/21, 07:34 - Ashwin: cn be controlled inimage itself as in jab tum edit karke daal rhe ho photoshop mein
11/15/21, 07:35 - Ashwin: other way would be using some external library
11/15/21, 07:35 - Tanushree: Any idea?
11/15/21, 07:35 - Tanushree: Dekhti isme
11/15/21, 07:36 - Tanushree: And how can you standardise the brightness, luminance, etc of multiple pictures?
11/15/21, 07:36 - Ashwin: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/setting-the-image-brightness-using-css3#:~:text=To%20set%20image%20brightness%20in,would%20make%20the%20image%20brighter.
11/15/21, 07:36 - Tanushree: Wo sab toh relatively change hona chaiye na?
11/15/21, 07:37 - Ashwin: luminance aur brightness mein kya farak
11/15/21, 07:37 - Ashwin: do you know how css works?
11/15/21, 07:37 - Ashwin: share me the link to website
11/15/21, 07:37 - Ashwin: or your remote desktop
11/15/21, 07:38 - Tanushree: I have no idea. Light reflect karti h, and khud ki light hoti ese karte.
Lol idk 😂
11/15/21, 07:39 - Tanushree: Konsa website?
11/15/21, 07:39 - Ashwin: jahan tum upload krti ho
11/15/21, 07:39 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
11/15/21, 07:39 - Ashwin: in practice its gonna be the same, plus how do you physically control the brightnes sof monitor
11/15/21, 07:39 - Tanushree: They said color range me ho jayega, meko toh samjh hi ni aara
11/15/21, 07:39 - Ashwin: haan same hi rhega photoshopmein
11/15/21, 07:40 - Tanushree: Well research papers set them all individually, so haan alag chize hain
11/15/21, 07:40 - Tanushree: Meko samjh ni ara par ye. I was trying YouTube dekhke, but they are doing kuch complex
11/15/21, 07:42 - Tanushree: https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-to-equalize-the-luminance-values-among-a-set-of-colored-pictures
11/15/21, 07:42 - Tanushree: What?
11/15/21, 07:43 - Tanushree: I wanna do this. But ye log hifi baatein karein
11/15/21, 07:51 - Ashwin: pixie cut will look good on you
11/15/21, 07:52 - Ashwin: but I am asking whats the point when you can change desktop settings
11/15/21, 07:53 - Tanushree: Open it🙂🙂🙂
11/15/21, 07:54 - Tanushree: Desktop setting for everyone who will be doing the experiment on their own laptop?
11/15/21, 07:54 - Tanushree: I wanna make all 150  photos similar on brightness, luminance, etc
11/15/21, 07:54 - Ashwin: Haan
11/15/21, 07:55 - Tanushree: So desktop ka change karne se, photos will still vary na?
11/15/21, 07:55 - Ashwin: Haan exactlt
11/15/21, 07:55 - Ashwin: I went through the thread
11/15/21, 07:56 - Ashwin: What he is suggesting is dynamically changing luminescence like using Matlab or open cv
11/15/21, 07:56 - Tanushree: Anddd
11/15/21, 07:56 - Ashwin: Usse bhi nhi Farak padega
11/15/21, 07:56 - Tanushree: Why use the word dynamically?
11/15/21, 07:56 - Tanushree: Ku?
11/15/21, 07:56 - Ashwin: What you were trying was through photoshop
11/15/21, 07:57 - Ashwin: What he suggested was programmatically
11/15/21, 07:57 - Ashwin: At the end it depends on contrast value of the monitor
11/15/21, 07:57 - Ashwin: Even if you ask or request to change values
11/15/21, 07:58 - Ashwin: Desktop with high resolution will always have better pixels to shoe
11/15/21, 07:58 - Tanushree: If two pictures are different, and they are made brighter together, then moniter ka brightness should vary na
11/15/21, 07:58 - Tanushree: Can I call?
11/15/21, 07:58 - Tanushree: Or

11/26/21, 07:20 - Ashwin: Haan mera bhi nhi ki mein ek hi line mein bolu capricious and arbitrary
11/26/21, 07:27 - Tanushree: And her sad story of wasting her life in this career 😂
11/26/21, 07:27 - Tanushree: Capriiiii
11/26/21, 07:30 - Ashwin: Yeah 💔
11/26/21, 07:30 - Ashwin: 🌽
11/26/21, 07:32 - Ashwin: The discussion about xenophobia is very nuanced actually. It's ingrained onto our collective minds to stay away from alien entities for our own safety. When "intellectuals" debate about immigration policy (if they are pro) it's more about trying to fight this tendency to box people as aliens where we know that they are good talented exports but our hearts tell us otherwise
11/26/21, 07:33 - Ashwin: Obviously it's not so simplified too
11/26/21, 07:33 - Tanushree: Pata ni
11/26/21, 07:33 - Tanushree: I guess I'm racist
11/26/21, 07:33 - Tanushree: So I don't care 😂😂
11/26/21, 07:33 - Tanushree: Can't say it outside India
11/26/21, 07:33 - Ashwin: Okay

11/27/21, 07:46 - Tanushree: So much typing for yeah
11/27/21, 07:57 - Ashwin: I was trying to write something but it sounded like a fanfic
11/27/21, 07:57 - Ashwin: So I scraped it
11/27/21, 08:42 - Tanushree: Men are in relationship with Xman and Ironman? 🙂
Bcoz sure seems like that 😂
11/27/21, 09:59 - Ashwin: 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:03 - Ashwin: I don't like x men or ironman
11/27/21, 10:03 - Ashwin: I like hugh
11/27/21, 10:04 - Tanushree: And his ass
11/27/21, 10:07 - Ashwin: 😂
11/27/21, 10:07 - Ashwin: Why you so fixated on that particular part of our anatomy
11/27/21, 10:07 - Tanushree: Idk
11/27/21, 10:08 - Tanushree: Why would a woman be interested in men's ass evolutionary?
11/27/21, 10:08 - Ashwin: Yeah that's true
11/27/21, 10:08 - Ashwin: For men it's completely acceptable from evolutionary standpoint
11/27/21, 10:08 - Ashwin: 😂
11/27/21, 10:08 - Tanushree: That's why I wondered. Why?
11/27/21, 10:09 - Ashwin: They even say women's mammary glands also evolved because they resembled buttocks
11/27/21, 10:09 - Ashwin: For procreation purposes
11/27/21, 10:09 - Ashwin: It's always that
11/27/21, 10:09 - Tanushree: As in? How?
11/27/21, 10:10 - Tanushree: This sounds like crap without explanation 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:10 - Ashwin: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/sex-relationships/sex/theres-scientific-reason-were-obsessed-8710087.amp
11/27/21, 10:10 - Ashwin: I couldn't read the thing but seems to be the one I was trying to present as evidenxe
11/27/21, 10:11 - Ashwin: But you just have to search with your good wifi
11/27/21, 10:13 - Tanushree: That's a wrong link
11/27/21, 10:13 - Tanushree: They are discussing breast here
11/27/21, 10:15 - Tanushree: https://www.inverse.com/science/butthead-chimpanzees-face-inversion-human-evolution-facial-recognition
11/27/21, 10:15 - Tanushree: Just read the heading 😂😂😂
11/27/21, 10:20 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
11/27/21, 10:20 - Ashwin: I was also discussing boobs
11/27/21, 10:21 - Tanushree: I thought they evolved bcoz they look like male butt 😂😂
Which sounded hilar
11/27/21, 10:21 - Ashwin: In the primate world, plump breasts last only as long as breastfeeding doesexcept in humans. Women are busty all the time, even after menopause. According to some scientists, the trait is an evolutionary trick for snagging men and signals a woman's ability to feed her children.
11/27/21, 10:21 - Ashwin: Hahaha
11/27/21, 10:22 - Ashwin: Hmmm could be one possible theory primates only need a place to hump
11/27/21, 10:22 - Tanushree: Ya. But why can cats have breast? They can also lure men cats no?
11/27/21, 10:22 - Ashwin: Cats don't have it
11/27/21, 10:22 - Ashwin: Cats have milk sac
11/27/21, 10:22 - Tanushree: Evolutionary psychology me every hypothesis can be justified 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:22 - Tanushree: But why can't they?
11/27/21, 10:22 - Tanushree: Can't male cats find them sexy?
11/27/21, 10:23 - Tanushree: Viola seduction
11/27/21, 10:23 - Tanushree: Why can all animals have it?
11/27/21, 10:23 - Ashwin: Because it puts felines walking on 4 legs at a disadvantage while breast feeding
11/27/21, 10:23 - Ashwin: It is easier for bipedals
11/27/21, 10:23 - Tanushree: But cows have it?
11/27/21, 10:23 - Ashwin: Oh there is plenty of creepy pasta on internet
11/27/21, 10:23 - Ashwin: They also have milk sacs
11/27/21, 10:24 - Tanushree: Um
11/27/21, 10:24 - Tanushree: Ok
11/27/21, 10:24 - Ashwin: At a place that's easily accessible by calves
11/27/21, 10:24 - Tanushree: There is difference?
11/27/21, 10:24 - Tanushree: 😂
11/27/21, 10:24 - Ashwin: I mean
11/27/21, 10:24 - Ashwin: Breast actually refers to the chest area
11/27/21, 10:24 - Ashwin: That's why the term breastpocket for men too
11/27/21, 10:25 - Ashwin: It just happened that milk sacs of primates coincided with that of their breast
11/27/21, 10:25 - Tanushree: Unhhn
11/27/21, 10:25 - Ashwin: Unnnnhhhh
11/27/21, 10:25 - Tanushree: Biologically kitna difference?
11/27/21, 10:25 - Tanushree: As in
11/27/21, 10:25 - Tanushree: Dono ka kam toh same hi
11/27/21, 10:26 - Ashwin: Milk sacs is one breaststroke are two to start with
11/27/21, 10:26 - Ashwin: Placement would also means milk producing glands would be at different places to that of absorption of nutrient area
11/27/21, 10:26 - Tanushree: I'll Google
11/27/21, 10:26 - Tanushree: You have been much helpful 😂
11/27/21, 10:26 - Ashwin: Yeah 💔
11/27/21, 10:26 - Tanushree: Monkeys have it
11/27/21, 10:27 - Ashwin: Okay google baba se poocho
11/27/21, 10:27 - Ashwin: I am just shooting blurbs and hypothesis indiscriminately
11/27/21, 10:27 - Tanushree: Evolutionary wale p thoda kam hi belief meko 😂
11/27/21, 10:28 - Ashwin: Haww
11/27/21, 10:28 - Tanushree: I'm like phoebe hefe
11/27/21, 10:28 - Ashwin: Charles Darwin would turn in his grave
11/27/21, 10:28 - Tanushree: Using for debate only 😂
11/27/21, 10:28 - Tanushree: No. Not like I don't beleive. But too much crap theories also
11/27/21, 10:28 - Ashwin: Yeah but phoebe exclusively debates to look cute
11/27/21, 10:28 - Tanushree: Debate to look cute? 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:28 - Ashwin: Yeah I got you
11/27/21, 10:28 - Tanushree: Is that a thing?
11/27/21, 10:29 - Ashwin: As in to say something against the normal flow of things
11/27/21, 10:29 - Ashwin: That's what phoebe stood for
11/27/21, 10:29 - Ashwin: She looked cute while doing it
11/27/21, 10:30 - Tanushree: Good
11/27/21, 10:31 - Tanushree: This seemed like she deliberately wanted to look cute 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:31 - Tanushree: You found her cute is a different story
11/27/21, 10:35 - Ashwin: I think that's what the creators went for
11/27/21, 10:36 - Ashwin: Like they could have made her all loud like oh my God character
11/27/21, 10:36 - Tanushree: They all looked cute doing whatever 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:36 - Ashwin: Or nerdy
11/27/21, 10:36 - Tanushree: Like Ross?
11/27/21, 10:36 - Ashwin: But no she would say the most innocuous things mostly as an addendum to whatever other people said
11/27/21, 10:36 - Ashwin: Ross dialogues also had plot value
11/27/21, 10:36 - Ashwin: No phoebes
11/27/21, 10:37 - Ashwin: Unless it was her episode
11/27/21, 10:37 - Tanushree: No she was fun and acted like a bond
11/27/21, 10:37 - Tanushree: Rest were like anyone else
11/27/21, 10:37 - Ashwin: Hmm see
11/27/21, 10:37 - Ashwin: Same with joey
11/27/21, 10:37 - Ashwin: And chandler before him and Monica got serious
11/27/21, 10:38 - Ashwin: Phoebe and Joey were fillers
11/27/21, 10:38 - Ashwin: A needed distraction tho
11/27/21, 10:38 - Ashwin: Now thats controversial
11/27/21, 10:38 - Tanushree: Well
11/27/21, 10:38 - Tanushree: Ya
11/27/21, 10:38 - Tanushree: Idk
11/27/21, 10:38 - Tanushree: Can't imagine the show without anyone
11/27/21, 10:38 - Tanushree: Soo
11/27/21, 10:39 - Tanushree: Filler ni lagta koi
11/27/21, 10:40 - Ashwin: Oh I could imagine it without phoebe and Joey
11/27/21, 10:40 - Ashwin: Hehe
11/27/21, 10:40 - Tanushree: Haan maybe thats the difference 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:41 - Tanushree: But maybe you can't imagine Rachel without Ross and Monica without Chandler and viva versa
11/27/21, 10:41 - Ashwin: What I am saying is
11/27/21, 10:41 - Tanushree: You don't wanna throw two characters out
11/27/21, 10:41 - Ashwin: There is no plot without them
11/27/21, 10:41 - Tanushree: That's why Phebe and joye are great targets 😂
11/27/21, 10:42 - Ashwin: Otherwise it's only gags in every episodes
11/27/21, 10:42 - Ashwin: Wow you make me look like a villian
11/27/21, 10:42 - Ashwin: What an underhanded strategy to win debates
11/27/21, 10:42 - Tanushree: Phebes ka toh relevance laga mujhe
11/27/21, 10:42 - Tanushree: Bcoz
11/27/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: Monica and Rachel were like posh rich kids, disconnected from many things
11/27/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: All of them were except her 😂
11/27/21, 10:43 - Tanushree: She added that.
11/27/21, 10:43 - Ashwin: She added what
11/27/21, 10:44 - Ashwin: Granted that she always told anecdotes about her cooking rats for breakfast
11/27/21, 10:44 - Ashwin: But throughout the show did you ever find phoebe in money troubles
11/27/21, 10:44 - Ashwin: Yet she sand did odd jobs
11/27/21, 10:44 - Ashwin: She was never in need of money to pay rent
11/27/21, 10:44 - Ashwin: Or anything
11/27/21, 10:44 - Tanushree: Phoebe and Joey both had na? Money issues
11/27/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: Even Rachel when she was doing odd jobs
11/27/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: Later she got fancy job
11/27/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: You don't remember that episode? 😂
11/27/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: Joey was dependent mostly.
11/27/21, 10:45 - Ashwin: So out of all the characters phoebe and Joey had the most hackneyed portrayal,  just for variety kind
11/27/21, 10:45 - Tanushree: Her pregnancy was pretty relevant too
11/27/21, 10:45 - Ashwin: Money issues as in they said oh man rich friends what to do
11/27/21, 10:46 - Tanushree: Like they showed variety of pregnancies. So that seemed added
11/27/21, 10:46 - Ashwin: While Rachel arc was more like rags to riches
11/27/21, 10:46 - Tanushree: I don't like Joey, so I can't defend his existence 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:47 - Ashwin: Okay. Yeah but even without it it would have been fine right
11/27/21, 10:47 - Ashwin: Like there were many things you could eliminate from show
11/27/21, 10:47 - Ashwin: Before the plot comes tumbling down entirely
11/27/21, 10:47 - Ashwin: Like you couldn't remove Ross and Rachel's dynamic
11/27/21, 10:47 - Ashwin: Or brother sister dynamic of Ross and monica
11/27/21, 10:48 - Ashwin: Or friends turned lover dynamic of chandler and monica
11/27/21, 10:48 - Ashwin: If Joey was successful eventually I would have said something about Joey. But his plot line never progressed anywhere throughout the series
11/27/21, 10:49 - Ashwin: Phoebe had a good romance arc and porn star twin(yuck most over used plot point) arc but I personally felt that was filler
11/27/21, 10:49 - Ashwin: You might have different ideas
11/27/21, 10:49 - Tanushree: Chandler and Monica dating each other wasn't too relevant also I guess then
11/27/21, 10:49 - Ashwin: It was
11/27/21, 10:49 - Tanushree: They both dating their neighbours would have been fine too
11/27/21, 10:49 - Tanushree: Their relationship was okayish
11/27/21, 10:49 - Tanushree: Like any romantic couple
11/27/21, 10:50 - Ashwin: Because it was always a question 6 people 3 men 3 women. Can they be f.r.i.e.n.d.s
11/27/21, 10:50 - Tanushree: Nothing Outta ordinary
11/27/21, 10:50 - Ashwin: They answered that question
11/27/21, 10:50 - Ashwin: I felt that was the entire thing the elephant in the room
11/27/21, 10:50 - Tanushree: Well they can be? 😂
11/27/21, 10:50 - Ashwin: Behind Ross and Rachel romance
11/27/21, 10:50 - Ashwin: But the creators addressed it
11/27/21, 10:51 - Ashwin: And instead of Ross and Rachel ending up together they did
11/27/21, 10:51 - Ashwin: That's something
11/27/21, 10:51 - Ashwin: Wow I never thought I was one of those persons debating over friends but here we are
11/27/21, 10:51 - Tanushree: But do you think it was necessary?
11/27/21, 10:51 - Tanushree: Like them having an equation was important
11/27/21, 10:51 - Tanushree: But not ending up together
11/27/21, 10:53 - Tanushree: They could always just decide they were toxic for each other and rachel could go to Paris. 
Monica chandler and Joey to whatever village. And Ross could just stay single signifying how one needn't be in relationship all the time 😂
11/27/21, 10:54 - Tanushree: You think some moments were more important than others. But I find Monica and chandler a little mundane.
11/27/21, 10:56 - Ashwin: I thought their chemistry of hiding the relationship
11/27/21, 10:57 - Ashwin: And then eventually coming out was nice
11/27/21, 10:57 - Tanushree: Nice but not necessary
11/27/21, 10:57 - Ashwin: A wisecrack marrying a control freak
11/27/21, 10:57 - Ashwin: Necessary as in it had a point
11/27/21, 10:57 - Tanushree: Chandler was pretty normal man 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:57 - Tanushree: Most men would say they are chandler
11/27/21, 10:57 - Ashwin: Normal you say
11/27/21, 10:57 - Tanushree: Bcoz he was so freaking normal
11/27/21, 10:58 - Ashwin: Could you *be* more underestimating in your evaluation
11/27/21, 10:58 - Ashwin: I don't think most men can have something sarcastic to say everytime
11/27/21, 10:59 - Ashwin: But yeah actually chandler was supposed to be the standing for regular joe
11/27/21, 10:59 - Tanushree: Then phoebes pregnancy had a point too. It's a tough decision having your brother's baby 😂😂
11/27/21, 10:59 - Ashwin: Who liked fancy things and had a n office job
11/27/21, 10:59 - Ashwin: But hey the regular job got a cute lady in the end
11/27/21, 10:59 - Ashwin: So we can dream right
11/27/21, 10:59 - Tanushree: And phoebe was so cool to do that 😂
11/27/21, 11:00 - Ashwin: It was nkt a thing most would relate to but yeah you could say that situation though convoluted was itneresting
11/27/21, 11:00 - Ashwin: I would have thought phoebe to be more "human" if she refused
11/27/21, 11:00 - Ashwin: It was expected of phoebe to do that
11/27/21, 11:00 - Tanushree: They always do. Bcoz women after 25 look for regular men only. Nothing fancy there too 😂
11/27/21, 11:01 - Ashwin: Ha well my experience is to the contrary
11/27/21, 11:01 - Ashwin: 😀
11/27/21, 11:01 - Tanushree: He was funny. But many men are. Idk, I don't think many women are 😂 so they would have kept her a female to keep chandler character relevant
11/27/21, 11:01 - Ashwin: Yeah read the rest
11/27/21, 11:02 - Tanushree: Which makes her existence in series relevant in a long run?
11/27/21, 11:03 - Tanushree: And idk not saying what you said is wrong. I'm just saying what you said is biased and subjective.
11/27/21, 11:04 - Tanushree: For you, one event is more relevant than other. For me it's different.
11/27/21, 11:04 - Tanushree: Can't imagine the show without those moments. This visualization could be subjective
11/27/21, 11:04 - Ashwin: Hehe subjective only as to what a sitcom stood for
11/27/21, 11:04 - Ashwin: Picture 6 cardboard character
11/27/21, 11:04 - Ashwin: Each representing a personality quirk
11/27/21, 11:05 - Ashwin: And the creators thought how to make it more relevant ?
11/27/21, 11:05 - Ashwin: Make it so that people relate
11/27/21, 11:06 - Ashwin: It's biased but usually that's what sitcoms are. They are supposed to draw in audience and hopefully the plot last for more than 3 seasons
11/27/21, 11:06 - Tanushree: Yes
11/27/21, 11:06 - Tanushree: For you, those are other characters. For me, other
11/27/21, 11:06 - Ashwin: That's why it's important to have characters like phoebe for relief
11/27/21, 11:07 - Ashwin: I feel I've touched a nerve
11/27/21, 11:07 - Ashwin: And have not been really sympathetic to phoebe
11/27/21, 11:08 - Ashwin: But out of everyone I like phoebe best. Which proves what? It's about an individuals experience with the series.
11/27/21, 11:07 - Tanushree: Ya
11/27/21, 11:08 - Tanushree: With what you said, I think the most important characters where Rachel and chandler. Rest were replaceable
11/27/21, 11:09 - Tanushree: If chandler and Rachel were together, chandler would handle that too nicely. Bcoz he was very accommodating
11/27/21, 11:09 - Ashwin: But usually people would find their character reflected in a lot of people on the show and situations and that would make it very palatable to larger audiences
11/27/21, 11:09 - Ashwin: Ross was repressing introverts
11/27/21, 11:10 - Ashwin: They might have
11/27/21, 11:10 - Ashwin: Representing
11/27/21, 11:11 - Tanushree: Chandler could do that too. He was awkward af 😂
11/27/21, 11:11 - Ashwin: What according to you was the plot of friends
11/27/21, 11:11 - Tanushree: Ross was representing nerds
11/27/21, 11:11 - Tanushree: People hanging out and not giving up on each other 😂
11/27/21, 11:11 - Tanushree: There was nothing more than that
11/27/21, 11:11 - Ashwin: Giving up as in
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: Like I lose friends
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: We all do right?
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: And I have this fear that I'll lose them all
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: And won't be able to make new ones
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: So no lasting relationships
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: But
11/27/21, 11:12 - Tanushree: They are lasting well together
11/27/21, 11:13 - Tanushree: When they didn't (with chandle and Monica moving), they closed the show.
11/27/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: Lasting well is upto debate
11/27/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: Well they could still make the show go on with chandler and monica coming back to central perk
11/27/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: They all didn't stay in the same building you know
11/27/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: But yes
11/27/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: But they were coming back right?
11/27/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: Then there was no reason to close the show
11/27/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: They didn't show them not being able to meet due to work, changing mutual interests, friends drifting apart
11/27/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: This is all theory
11/27/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: For the n number of seasons this could have happened
11/27/21, 11:15 - Ashwin: It just didn't happen because well the screenwriter didn't make it happen
11/27/21, 11:15 - Tanushree: Yes
11/27/21, 11:15 - Ashwin: I could easily picture an ark in which one of the friends drifted apart and came back triumphantly in the last season
11/27/21, 11:15 - Ashwin: But yes what you said is correct t
11/27/21, 11:15 - Tanushree: And all in all, whatever happens, you will always have friends to help you. And you won't be alone
11/27/21, 11:15 - Ashwin: Friends is also about constancy
11/27/21, 11:16 - Ashwin: And safe assumption that everything would be all right in friends villw
11/27/21, 11:16 - Ashwin: Through ups and downs life would be same
11/27/21, 11:16 - Ashwin: You can come back from work and see the friends hanging out
11/27/21, 11:17 - Ashwin: And you felt see atleast the friends were still together
11/27/21, 11:18 - Ashwin: I felt it's more about constancy because I didn't see any character development throughout the show like significant. Gunther didn't go on and love someone else. And Joey's was most dissapointing
11/27/21, 11:18 - Ashwin: Sometimes you don't want things to change
11/27/21, 11:19 - Ashwin: And yes friends together is a nice blanket on top
11/27/21, 11:19 - Ashwin: But the reality is if Joey was to be big bang successful he couldn't  be making rounds in Central perk
11/27/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: The price of ambition might be losing your friends. But our emotional core wouldn't want it.
11/27/21, 11:16 - Tanushree: And this doesn't happen to everyone 😂 (most of us ig)
11/27/21, 11:16 - Tanushree: We deal with out issues alone
11/27/21, 11:16 - Tanushree: Nowwww
11/27/21, 11:16 - Tanushree: That's getting senti
11/27/21, 11:16 - Tanushree: Soo that, you asked the plot, I gave you the plot 😂
11/27/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: In the end perhaps it was all for fun and gags.
11/27/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: I wrote a bit much
11/27/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: And I gave you the underlying plot if you upto reading it
11/27/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: I always do. So good for a change 😂
11/27/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: 🌝
11/27/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
11/27/21, 11:22 - Tanushree: How did I not say the same thing bro? 😂😂😂
11/27/21, 11:22 - Tanushree: But Janice did 😂 David became mature and determined.
11/27/21, 11:35 - Ashwin: Okay bro a lapse in my understanding
11/27/21, 11:36 - Ashwin: Because being friends together through highs and lows in practice means being stagnant
11/27/21, 11:36 - Ashwin: And that is what I wanted to highlight
11/27/21, 11:37 - Ashwin: The repercussions of I'll be there for you always
11/27/21, 11:37 - Ashwin: Character development for irritating characters is easy and also welcome
11/27/21, 11:37 - Tanushree: Would you rather have that? I might 😂
11/27/21, 11:38 - Ashwin: Character development of comfortable character the characters you've come to like/ignore is path breaking
11/27/21, 11:38 - Ashwin: What's that
11/27/21, 11:38 - Tanushree: All of them were kinda asshole if we really look 😂
11/27/21, 11:39 - Ashwin: But we don't thats the beauty of it. Mesmerized by the playful banter their lives seem perfect
11/27/21, 11:40 - Ashwin: You're late to the party
11/27/21, 11:38 - Tanushree: Being stagnant to maintain relationships
11/27/21, 11:42 - Tanushree: Me how?
11/27/21, 11:43 - Ashwin: Yes to a certain degree but in relationship usually its about 2 people. But put 6 Into the mix (people of varying interests and path to development) and you'll find it almost impossible
11/27/21, 11:43 - Ashwin: Deep fakes is old new. But yes good to spread the word
11/27/21, 11:43 - Tanushree: 😂😂 idk. I have recently started caring less but I'm still a people pleaser at heart 😂
11/27/21, 11:43 - Ashwin: You know tho
11/27/21, 11:44 - Ashwin: People have the capability to be people pleaser even they are self aware of what exactly they are doing
11/27/21, 11:44 - Tanushree: Oh that's for you and people in tech. Major of people outside the tech world dont about it.
11/27/21, 11:44 - Tanushree: It's important for common and polarised people to know what is see need not be real, else those dumbfucks will Lynch someone 😂😂😂
11/27/21, 11:45 - Tanushree: True. Merese toh 1 bhi ni handle hota 🥲
I wonder how most people do it. I constantly obsess over it 😂
11/27/21, 11:51 - Tanushree: I try not to, but I sometimes do 😂
11/27/21, 11:51 - Ashwin: True. What I am saying is people on your whatsapp list would be aware of it. Why preach it to them.
11/27/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: For instance, I feel if I don't reply quick, I'll be failing people. Soooo even before my exam I keep doing that 😂
11/27/21, 11:52 - Ashwin: Yeah spread the word on Twitter or a public insta page 😀
11/27/21, 11:52 - Ashwin: 😂😂
11/27/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: No. Even aman won't know about it. Unless he saw his video before me sharing 😂😂
11/27/21, 11:53 - Ashwin: And everytime you say idk. I know that your educated opinion on the same subject would follow 😂😂
11/27/21, 11:54 - Ashwin: Okay as a lawyer digital laws and frameworks regarding ai and cryptoand ip are a great field to get into
11/27/21, 11:54 - Ashwin: Right now
11/27/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: Like he can create his own niche. A place where oldies would fear to tread. He should
11/27/21, 11:59 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
11/27/21, 12:01 - Ashwin: I also had this habit. I got offended if people left me on read.
11/27/21, 11:53 - Tanushree: 12 people follow me on insta 😂😂
11/27/21, 11:53 - Tanushree: Sorry, twitter.
11/27/21, 12:06 - Ashwin: Tag elon
11/27/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: Idk I'm not yet clear but... 😂
11/27/21, 12:07 - Tanushree: He might if he doesn't get what is currently trying for. Let's see
11/27/21, 12:08 - Tanushree: I used to get anxious 😂  then I closed my blue tick
Yours is on?
11/27/21, 12:08 - Tanushree: 😂
11/27/21, 12:10 - Tanushree: We studies it in last sem of consciousness. Embodied cognition. I'm a great believer 😂
11/27/21, 12:11 - Ashwin: That's a clear as one would ever be
11/27/21, 12:11 - Tanushree: My level of awareness goes deeper than many other bcoz they don't have a field where they should know cognition and emotion? 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:11 - Ashwin: Xool
11/27/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: A very lofty opinion of yourself ? 😀
11/27/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: Yes. I also gave then the same treatment
11/27/21, 12:12 - Ashwin: Okay 🙂
11/27/21, 12:13 - Tanushree: I mean your programming skills are better than many. That's fact. You studies this for 4 years. If you can't acknowledge that, we'll work on your self awareness 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:14 - Tanushree: But if start my blue ticks. I'll again start being anxious when people don't reply 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:15 - Ashwin: Why do you turn it on me when you were talking about yourself 🙂
11/27/21, 12:15 - Ashwin: Okay. That's when you realise the benefit of having an relatively large ego
11/27/21, 12:15 - Tanushree: Example tha. When you do something for a long time, you start knowing more. That's not against anyone else 😂
11/27/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: You egoistic?
11/27/21, 12:16 - Ashwin: Okay I started programming after I got into navy ngl
11/27/21, 12:16 - Tanushree: And you were practicing on me?
11/27/21, 12:16 - Ashwin: If I had started before I would have had a different career path
11/27/21, 12:17 - Tanushree: That was an example 😂 replace that with computers
11/27/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Yes.
11/27/21, 12:17 - Tanushree: Khush? 😂
11/27/21, 12:17 - Tanushree: Cute
11/27/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: Even that I have problems agreeing. But okay
11/27/21, 12:17 - Ashwin: 🙂
11/27/21, 12:17 - Tanushree: It's okay. Leave it open ended 😂
11/27/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: I said I don't agree. It's not open ended
11/27/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: I've agreed to disagree
11/27/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: 👀
11/27/21, 12:18 - Tanushree: Good 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: What are you doing today
11/27/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: Prepared lunch? 🤭
11/27/21, 12:18 - Tanushree: It's saturday
11/27/21, 12:18 - Tanushree: They cancelled.
11/27/21, 12:18 - Ashwin: Kehndi h kudi
11/27/21, 12:18 - Tanushree: I'll think of something normal
11/27/21, 12:19 - Ashwin: Dubbawala?
11/27/21, 12:19 - Tanushree: 🙂
11/27/21, 12:19 - Tanushree: They do often
11/27/21, 12:19 - Ashwin: Yeah please don't try to make a snake roast with flies
11/27/21, 12:19 - Ashwin: You should live in Mumbai
11/27/21, 12:20 - Ashwin: Dubbawala are most reliable there
11/27/21, 12:20 - Tanushree: 🙂🙂🙂 I'm not planning to. Unless I find on in my toilet
11/27/21, 12:21 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
11/27/21, 12:21 - Tanushree: 😂😂
I need proper meal once a day. Then toh me dudh pikar bhi chala leti 😂
11/27/21, 12:21 - Ashwin: Are there snakes there?
11/27/21, 12:21 - Tanushree: No 😂
11/27/21, 12:21 - Ashwin: Apart from people in your college
11/27/21, 12:22 - Ashwin: Ohh 😂
11/27/21, 12:22 - Ashwin: But you have high metabolism
11/27/21, 12:22 - Ashwin: You should have more
11/27/21, 12:22 - Ashwin: Otherwise I won't be able to say objectively hot
11/27/21, 12:23 - Tanushree: I don't quite agree with this.
Yes I'm a pain in ass as much as I realise how much I say it 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:23 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
11/27/21, 12:23 - Tanushree: Haan I compensate with junk 😂
11/27/21, 12:23 - Tanushree: You won't be able to say 'you would be'
11/27/21, 12:23 - Tanushree: 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:24 - Ashwin: So lemme get this straight. You are saying you'll compensate your need for milk from junk.
11/27/21, 12:24 - Ashwin: Okay.
11/27/21, 12:24 - Ashwin: Moving on.
11/27/21, 12:24 - Ashwin: It's about people dying and God's plan. What re you talking about 🙂
11/27/21, 12:24 - Tanushree: I mean, I can have both
11/27/21, 12:24 - Tanushree: Lota banana chips. You wnna have?
11/27/21, 12:26 - Ashwin: Yes.
11/27/21, 12:26 - Ashwin: I didn't have much this time around
11/27/21, 12:26 - Tanushree: People getting killed can be a part of god's plan
11/27/21, 12:26 - Tanushree: Soooo ya that's it 😂
11/27/21, 12:27 - Tanushree: Yes what? 😂
11/27/21, 12:27 - Tanushree: You have citi card?
11/27/21, 12:27 - Ashwin: Hmm yes. And the strip mentions it is inches away from saying the jews were killed because they deserved it
11/27/21, 12:27 - Ashwin: I would like a banana chip
11/27/21, 12:27 - Ashwin: Can you parcel it to mudgaon
11/27/21, 12:27 - Ashwin: Sorry ratnagiri now
11/27/21, 12:27 - Ashwin: Do it before it become panvel
11/27/21, 12:27 - Tanushree: No one (atleast I didn't) says god kills people who deserve it. It's just a part of plan
11/27/21, 12:28 - Tanushree: Haan photo khate ho aap? Do you have 3D print? 😂
11/27/21, 12:28 - Ashwin: So the jews all of em were killed because of a plan
11/27/21, 12:28 - Tanushree: Yes
11/27/21, 12:28 - Tanushree: Could be 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:29 - Ashwin: Hmm so God doesn't care about you or me then
11/27/21, 12:29 - Ashwin: He cares about his plan
11/27/21, 12:29 - Tanushree: Not really.
11/27/21, 12:29 - Tanushree: His concern may not really be you or me or the population
11/27/21, 12:29 - Tanushree: It just maybe something else.
11/27/21, 12:29 - Tanushree: Idk
11/27/21, 12:29 - Ashwin: That's exactly what I said
11/27/21, 12:29 - Tanushree: I have my hypothesis. Others may have their own
11/27/21, 12:29 - Ashwin: His concern is his plan
11/27/21, 12:30 - Tanushree: I won't listen to someone say 'dont say it was god's plan when someone survives' bcoz I will. It fits my hypothesis 😂
11/27/21, 12:30 - Ashwin: 😂😂 if I have 3d printing material banana
11/27/21, 12:30 - Ashwin: Okay
11/27/21, 12:31 - Ashwin: But it clearly leads us to think that God doesn't care about anyone
11/27/21, 12:31 - Ashwin: I can die tomorrow and you'll live because God's plan
11/27/21, 12:32 - Ashwin: 😭
11/27/21, 12:32 - Ashwin: You can go make your lunch
11/27/21, 12:32 - Ashwin: I keep engaging you into explosive discussions 🙂
11/27/21, 12:33 - Ashwin: And since I am sitting in train I have time to respond :)
11/27/21, 12:34 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
11/27/21, 12:30 - Tanushree: I'll send the prototype 😂
11/27/21, 12:31 - Tanushree: Don't ignore your part towards this relationship.
11/27/21, 12:35 - Ashwin: I happily acknowledge I do not
11/27/21, 12:35 - Ashwin: What are you buying
11/27/21, 12:38 - Tanushree: I didn't say that. It's faith. You can believe he cares, or he hates you. Doesn't prove any point.
11/27/21, 12:39 - Tanushree: But I like to believe he cares. And he has plans, even if devastating things keep happening
11/27/21, 12:39 - Tanushree: Ya bcoz you are train and not going for a run
11/27/21, 12:40 - Ashwin: He cares for his plan
11/27/21, 12:40 - Ashwin: Nanana
11/27/21, 12:40 - Tanushree: 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:41 - Ashwin: The fact that devastating thing happens shows to me that he doesn't care about people
11/27/21, 12:41 - Ashwin: Why should he care about you
11/27/21, 12:41 - Ashwin: You are not special babe
11/27/21, 12:40 - Tanushree: Everyone relationship with God is different
11/27/21, 12:41 - Tanushree: Some fear their god. I don't. My god is a caring parents but I might be his first favourite daughter.
11/27/21, 12:41 - Tanushree: Aww me getting senti 😂😂
11/27/21, 12:42 - Tanushree: When one kid dies in a road accident, the parent goes and spreads awareness, fix the road so many other don't die.
Maybe it was his plan.
11/27/21, 12:43 - Tanushree: That was an example
11/27/21, 12:44 - Tanushree: Are you your parents favourite child? If they had to save just one kid, would it be you or your brother?
11/27/21, 12:44 - Tanushree: And life without crisis and scarcity won't be appreciated
11/27/21, 13:14 - Ashwin: If my parents were in control of the universe would they have made a child die for a lesson?
11/27/21, 13:14 - Ashwin: That's a post incident reasoning I find very problematic
11/27/21, 13:16 - Ashwin: You are supposing that people who survived are entitled to appreciate their survival and so that makes It okay for other people who were dead to remain dead
11/27/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: It wasn't a lesson.
11/27/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: And why should their just be one god? There maybe many.
11/27/21, 13:42 - Ashwin: So
11/27/21, 13:42 - Tanushree: I don't. Parents will save their child at expense of 5 other.
11/27/21, 13:42 - Tanushree: My god is superb, but not not his favourite
11/27/21, 13:43 - Tanushree: And your reasoning my be right for you
11/27/21, 13:43 - Ashwin: Hey but here both are their child 😂
11/27/21, 13:43 - Tanushree: But I don't believe the world would be better place without suffering and deaths. So that should happen
11/27/21, 13:43 - Tanushree: Many gods many children 😂
11/27/21, 13:43 - Tanushree: Plus, not all have the same preference.
11/27/21, 13:44 - Ashwin: So why would there be a heaven in existence
11/27/21, 13:44 - Tanushree: You maybe more or less important than others
11/27/21, 13:44 - Ashwin: I mean if you think there should be a heaven
11/27/21, 13:44 - Ashwin: What I meant was
11/27/21, 13:44 - Tanushree: I didn't say there is a heavan or not a heavan
11/27/21, 13:44 - Ashwin: Why can't we all be eternally blissful beings
11/27/21, 13:44 - Ashwin: Why should there be suffering
11/27/21, 13:44 - Tanushree: Maybe we are and we don't acknowledge that.
11/27/21, 13:45 - Tanushree: No one can tell for sure if we are already in heavan
11/27/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: Yes okay. So now you force me to add inclusions. Why can't everyone be blissful and acknowledge it.
11/27/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: Heaven as a concept where everyone is satisfied
11/27/21, 13:45 - Tanushree: It may not be in god's hand
11/27/21, 13:45 - Tanushree: Bcoz he is not alone
11/27/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: And this world isn't that
11/27/21, 13:46 - Tanushree: Like have you read any mythologies? 😂😂
11/27/21, 13:46 - Tanushree: When there is good, there is evit
11/27/21, 13:46 - Ashwin: Okay so you are saying many gods are tussling with each other
11/27/21, 13:46 - Tanushree: No. With evil
11/27/21, 13:46 - Ashwin: God's of Anima right
11/27/21, 13:46 - Ashwin: Okay 😂
11/27/21, 13:46 - Ashwin: So God is also a being who is not very powerful
11/27/21, 13:46 - Tanushree: Alsoooo
11/27/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: Why you gotta believe God has it all figured out? 😂😂
11/27/21, 13:47 - Ashwin: Is that what you are saying
11/27/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: Naah
11/27/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: My god isn't 😂
11/27/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: He just tries to take care of me but then, sometimes he can't
11/27/21, 13:47 - Ashwin: Okay so now that we have brought God down from the pedestal of all seeing
11/27/21, 13:47 - Ashwin: Why have a mid tier being at all
11/27/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: And I'm allowed to get angry and stop talking to him 😂
11/27/21, 13:47 - Ashwin: That's your dad
11/27/21, 13:48 - Ashwin: Again your mom
11/27/21, 13:48 - Tanushree: Bcoz I can't discuss all my fears and insecurities with you. And even if I will, you can't assure me that it will be okay
11/27/21, 13:48 - Ashwin: You believe you have a Godfather who is literally God. Expect he is semi powerful
11/27/21, 13:48 - Tanushree: But I can discuss with my god and just beleive that he will take care of it if he thinks so
11/27/21, 13:49 - Tanushree: Yes
11/27/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: Okay but I can lend you an ear if you ever want to
11/27/21, 13:49 - Tanushree: You are a hindu 😂 there is no one god. And even gods have their flaws
11/27/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: But I don't know how much of help a mere mortal can be
11/27/21, 13:49 - Tanushree: That doesn't help man
11/27/21, 13:49 - Tanushree: Sometimes friends will say things I don't wanna hear
11/27/21, 13:50 - Tanushree: And it might make me more angry than not
11/27/21, 13:50 - Ashwin: Okay but your personal God will?
11/27/21, 13:50 - Tanushree: Yes
11/27/21, 13:50 - Ashwin: Which begs the question is your personal God inside you
11/27/21, 13:50 - Tanushree: Try telling him/her/preferred pronoun?
11/27/21, 13:50 - Tanushree: Omnipresent 😂
11/27/21, 13:50 - Ashwin: They
11/27/21, 13:51 - Ashwin: Okay now we have brought God to metaphysical chamers of your body
11/27/21, 13:51 - Ashwin: Is he your sub concious
11/27/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: He maybe
11/27/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: He maybe not
11/27/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: Seeee
11/27/21, 13:51 - Ashwin: Since he know what you want to hear
11/27/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: Faith ka matlab pata h kya hota?
11/27/21, 13:52 - Tanushree: You neednt know everything to believe in something 😂😂
11/27/21, 13:52 - Tanushree: That helps with my anxiety. Knowing someone has my back
11/27/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: But what you wnat to hear may not make you angry
11/27/21, 13:52 - Tanushree: I didn't believe before.
11/27/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: But maybe it's not the best advice
11/27/21, 13:52 - Tanushree: But after few episodes of hopelessness, it happened automatically
11/27/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: Yes. Agreed. But faith should have some utility
11/27/21, 13:53 - Tanushree: Sometimes I don't want advice
11/27/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: Blind faith in a God that only cares about his design ain't much of a help
11/27/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: Okay
11/27/21, 13:54 - Ashwin: In your case then there is utility
11/27/21, 13:54 - Ashwin: You want a sympathetic ear
11/27/21, 13:54 - Tanushree: Has na. I get anxious to a point of being destructive. But when I think about things logically, they aren't comforting.
Having a philosophical backup support helps 😂😂
11/27/21, 13:54 - Tanushree: Yes.
11/27/21, 13:55 - Ashwin: Unrelated though I would be ready to lend you a sympathetic ear when time requires. I Mena you can talk to me. And also say you don't need advice so 8ll just listen
11/27/21, 13:55 - Ashwin: Yeah 😄
11/27/21, 13:55 - Tanushree: I mean, you won't know na. Friends won't know when and what to say.
11/27/21, 13:56 - Tanushree: And I can get angry with God and not talk to him and again start
11/27/21, 13:56 - Tanushree: You won't tolerate that behaviour 😂😂
11/27/21, 13:56 - Ashwin: I might
11/27/21, 13:56 - Ashwin: But okay
11/27/21, 13:56 - Ashwin: Yeah not everytime
11/27/21, 13:56 - Tanushree: Where is that big ass ego?
11/27/21, 13:56 - Ashwin: Ego has a time and place
11/27/21, 13:57 - Tanushree: You neednt bear someone being toxic 😂
11/27/21, 13:57 - Tanushree: Also, I can't physically hit god. So he is safe 😂
11/27/21, 13:57 - Ashwin: Toxic people who aren't aware they are being need help
11/27/21, 13:58 - Ashwin: But it gets messy real fast
11/27/21, 13:58 - Ashwin: 😂
11/27/21, 13:58 - Ashwin: You can't hit me I am miles away
11/27/21, 14:30 - Tanushree: 😂😂
11/27/21, 14:30 - Tanushree: God helps everything tho
11/27/21, 14:53 - Ashwin: Okay

11/27/21, 17:26 - Ashwin: See and at what cost to you
11/27/21, 17:26 - Ashwin: Nothing right you need to have done nothing
11/27/21, 17:27 - Tanushree: People usually don't, but people still worry 😂
11/27/21, 17:27 - Tanushree: That's why faith? Bcoz life is not certain and it adds to the chaos
11/27/21, 17:28 - Ashwin: 👍 👌
11/27/21, 17:28 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>

12/3/21, 13:39 - Tanushree: Well
12/3/21, 13:39 - Ashwin: So lemme give you advice on that
12/3/21, 13:40 - Ashwin: Also I am not proud of it
12/3/21, 13:40 - Tanushree: I don't have much experience of knowing what to do with emotions which are probably like cheating
12/3/21, 13:40 - Tanushree: 😂
12/3/21, 13:40 - Ashwin: Emotions are not cheating
12/3/21, 13:40 - Ashwin: It's your choice of acting jn it

12/3/21, 13:42 - Tanushree: Bcoz I'll leave and never see her again right?
12/3/21, 13:42 - Ashwin: Maybe the anticipation is increasing your libido
12/3/21, 13:42 - Tanushree: It's not too much
12/3/21, 13:43 - Tanushree: I don't have libido so early on sooo 😂😂
12/3/21, 13:43 - Ashwin: No most definitely you can find excuses to atleast visit her if you choose to do so. After all she has taken over your project.

12/3/21, 13:44 - Ashwin: But whether you'll see her or not shouldn't be the first consideration. First consideration is confirming what you feel.

12/3/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: They can eat those who have slowed down after running so much
12/3/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: Or won't get anything to eat if it gains so much
12/3/21, 18:58 - Ashwin: But then that would help her lose weight. Which would make her eat. And thus gain weight. Perpetual cycle.

12/3/21, 19:44 - Ashwin: Death is about being laid back don't you agree. Life is about hyperactiveness
12/3/21, 19:44 - Tanushree: No I don't agree

12/4/21, 08:36 - Ashwin: Why you saying thus tho
12/4/21, 08:36 - Ashwin: This
12/4/21, 08:36 - Tanushree: It looks partially serious na
12/4/21, 08:36 - Tanushree: Toh bol bol k or serious ho jayeha
12/4/21, 08:36 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/4/21, 08:36 - Ashwin: 😂😂
12/4/21, 08:37 - Ashwin: Nhi I don't know, but I think utna serious nhi from her side too
12/4/21, 08:37 - Ashwin: But she talks nicely to me so I feel she is interested.
12/4/21, 08:38 - Ashwin: But we are at that dusky phase between morning and Night where nothing is sure. If you say good night they might say abhi toh subah hi h
12/4/21, 08:40 - Ashwin: I also lack the guts to say to her ki can we just do bf gf thing without thinking long term. So I just let it hang it in the air. And she also doesn't seem to be keen on address it. So we talk like friends
12/4/21, 08:40 - Ashwin: Probably for the best
12/4/21, 08:40 - Tanushree: Itna complicated hai ya tum dono bana rahe?
12/4/21, 08:41 - Ashwin: Mein bana rha uska pta nhi
12/4/21, 08:41 - Tanushree: It will be difficult for you, uska toh pata ni meko. To really decide if you should go out with someone else or not
12/4/21, 08:41 - Ashwin: Yes exactly
12/4/21, 08:42 - Ashwin: I mean I can why not
12/4/21, 08:42 - Ashwin: I try to ask her in between koi aur mila tinder pe
12/4/21, 08:42 - Ashwin: Then she somehow sidesteps and says weird guys she met 😂
12/4/21, 08:43 - Tanushree: Is the friendship worth so much ambiguity? 😂
12/4/21, 08:44 - Ashwin: I don't want to hurt her feelings. (Also I don't know why I think I can, like I don't even know if she is that invested).
12/4/21, 08:44 - Tanushree: Women have options. Almost all of them.
12/4/21, 08:44 - Tanushree: So if she is not asking, most women prefer men do that
12/4/21, 08:45 - Tanushree: So you should ask
12/4/21, 08:45 - Tanushree: One has to be assertive
12/4/21, 08:45 - Ashwin: I am scared somehow of hurting her feeling. That would be better way to put it. So not like a noble hero or anything
12/4/21, 08:45 - Tanushree: I understand. But you don't have to reject her or give any ultimatum
12/4/21, 08:45 - Tanushree: Just address what you are wondering about
12/4/21, 08:45 - Tanushree: And what she things is happening
12/4/21, 08:46 - Ashwin: Okay love guru

12/10/21, 10:06 - Ashwin: Don't know about the red ones utility as in occasions where you can wear
12/10/21, 10:10 - Tanushree: Utility is only like 'if it looks good, let's keep it' sorts
12/10/21, 10:10 - Tanushree: Elaborate
12/10/21, 10:10 - Tanushree: Am I looking fat?
12/10/21, 11:31 - Tanushree: https://youtu.be/FGz50MnGzzw 😂
12/10/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: No it looks extra to me
12/10/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: Like you trying hard to standout type maybe unnatural
12/10/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: But that's just me
12/10/21, 13:54 - Ashwin: Okay but also how many times will you wear it
12/10/21, 13:54 - Ashwin: But no now that I look at it again the top suits you
12/10/21, 13:55 - Ashwin: But the latter part is what is problematic
12/10/21, 14:02 - Tanushree: It's a normal long sweater 😂
12/10/21, 14:02 - Tanushree: I usually don't wear anything many times
12/10/21, 14:03 - Tanushree: Latter? Over?
12/10/21, 14:04 - Ashwin: Why are wearing it like a dress then
12/10/21, 14:04 - Ashwin: As sweater it's good
12/10/21, 14:05 - Tanushree: Utility like you said 😂
12/10/21, 14:05 - Tanushree: It will look fine only if worn like a sweater
12/10/21, 14:05 - Tanushree: But I have such sweaters
12/10/21, 14:05 - Tanushree: I was seeing if it looks good as a dress also or not
12/10/21, 14:06 - Ashwin: Cool but wear something underneath 🤣
12/10/21, 14:06 - Tanushree: Stocks or boots I was thinking
12/10/21, 14:06 - Tanushree: But abhi toh I'm taking opinions 😂😂
12/10/21, 14:07 - Ashwin: The opinion is that
12/10/21, 14:07 - Ashwin: It is too long to be short above the knees
12/10/21, 14:07 - Ashwin: To short to be a dress below it
12/10/21, 14:07 - Ashwin: It is just coming at knees
12/10/21, 14:07 - Ashwin: That's why maybe it's looking..wrong?
12/10/21, 14:08 - Ashwin: Or 60s style miniskirt
12/10/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: I wish you were better at communicating 😂😂
12/10/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: Bcoz you are trying to say something logical
12/10/21, 14:08 - Ashwin: How much more elaborate can I be 👍
12/10/21, 14:08 - Ashwin: 🤣
12/10/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: But isn't making sense to me rn
12/10/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/10/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: Are you trying to say that dresses which end at knees look wrong?
12/10/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: This looks wrong
12/10/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: Because it tapers at your knees
12/10/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: It should have been wider
12/10/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: Or maybe like body fit skirts that people I  high heels wear
12/10/21, 14:09 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂

12/11/21, 00:37 - Tanushree: One is more emotional and long term
12/11/21, 00:37 - Tanushree: And another is reckless and exciting
12/11/21, 00:37 - Tanushree: And I can't say this one is not important. I'll get bored otherwise
12/11/21, 00:38 - Tanushree: So ya, sex maybe in that department

12/11/21, 00:39 - Ashwin: Though I didn't really think it was that important even
12/11/21, 00:39 - Tanushree: Wese hi sex maybe
12/11/21, 00:39 - Tanushree: But then, I won't die without it
12/11/21, 00:40 - Ashwin: Excitement comes from a lot of things no
12/11/21, 00:40 - Ashwin: Not just sex
12/11/21, 00:40 - Tanushree: I'll sulk a little, get distracted, but that's still okqy

12/11/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: I think I have stopped valuing the physical aspect that much
12/11/21, 00:42 - Tanushree: Ab baat karte time video quality achi aa jaye, wo bhi kafi sahi lagta h 😂😂😂
12/11/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: That's why I was wondering If sex was integral then long distance shouldn't even exist
12/11/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: For many it doesn't
12/11/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: Due to the same reason
12/11/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: For phone sex? 😅😂
12/11/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 00:43 - Tanushree: Baat karna means literally just baat karna 😂😂
12/11/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 00:43 - Ashwin: Okay but yeah
12/11/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: Aman doesn't have his own room. There is always someone with him
12/11/21, 00:44 - Ashwin: This option is there for long distance
12/11/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: So that way, bas baat karne ko mil jaye, that is pretty good 😂
12/11/21, 00:44 - Ashwin: I don't know how valid
12/11/21, 00:44 - Ashwin: 👍
12/11/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: Sabka alag chalta h
12/11/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: But personally
12/11/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: Mujhe itna important ni lagta
12/11/21, 00:44 - Tanushree: Pehle lagta tha
12/11/21, 00:45 - Ashwin: But you said uppar ki yes
12/11/21, 00:45 - Tanushree: I used to think kafi important hota hai. Lekin ab ni lagta 😂
12/11/21, 00:45 - Ashwin: There might be some truth to that too
12/11/21, 00:45 - Tanushree: It's important if you are trying not to cheat ☺️
12/11/21, 00:45 - Tanushree: But how common is that? 😂
12/11/21, 00:45 - Ashwin: Matlab?
12/11/21, 00:46 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: Idk if it's boredom or lack of physical intimacy
12/11/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: But if you are attracted to someone else
12/11/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: It's a good reality check
12/11/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: That run back to your partner
12/11/21, 00:46 - Tanushree: Bcoz you guys are losing it 😂
12/11/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: If you have sex with someone else? Or your partner
12/11/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: If you are attracted to someone else
12/11/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: Sexually
12/11/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: That's it
12/11/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: You don't have to do anything
12/11/21, 00:47 - Tanushree: Just the idea of it
12/11/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: Okay then you go and do it with your partner
12/11/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: To curb the feelings
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: Not really 😂
12/11/21, 00:48 - Ashwin: 😂😂
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: Go and think what is happening
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: And if you can't do it alone
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: Discuss 😂
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: That is it happening
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: Boredom is pretty common anywhere
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: So there
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: Sex is important I guess
12/11/21, 00:48 - Tanushree: But if you are able to get back on track
12/11/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: Pretty quickly
12/11/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: Then it may not be important
12/11/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: That much
12/11/21, 00:49 - Ashwin: Okay so you are basically trying to say
12/11/21, 00:49 - Ashwin: Sex will drive the relationship when aag thandi hi jaaye
12/11/21, 00:49 - Tanushree: Sex might*
12/11/21, 00:50 - Ashwin: It is that tinder to fire
12/11/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: And no, I'm not saying that also 😂😂
12/11/21, 00:50 - Ashwin: That's why they named it tinder
12/11/21, 00:50 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: I'm just saying, it will be less likely
12/11/21, 00:50 - Ashwin: For you to be attracted to someone else
12/11/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: That's chemistry wala fire 😂
That something is burning.
12/11/21, 00:50 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 00:51 - Ashwin: Okay.
12/11/21, 00:51 - Ashwin: What if you get the man of your dreams ( let's say you didn't meet aman)
12/11/21, 00:51 - Ashwin: And he isn't good in bed
12/11/21, 00:51 - Ashwin: What then
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Usually people communicate
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Like any other department
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Kya acha ni hai
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Instructions
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: What can be improved
12/11/21, 00:52 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Koi pet se toh mast hoke ni aata? 😂
12/11/21, 00:52 - Ashwin: And if it doesn't improve
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Practice chaiye thodi
12/11/21, 00:52 - Tanushree: Then don't take it on your ego and get a sex toy 😂
12/11/21, 00:53 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: Bcoz relationship is not important than that 😂
12/11/21, 00:53 - Ashwin: But that's because you would like to be in that relationship as you value all your relationship as such
12/11/21, 00:53 - Ashwin: Oh
12/11/21, 00:53 - Tanushree: More*
12/11/21, 00:53 - Ashwin: As in not important than sex
12/11/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: Important
12/11/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: Bc meri typing is so bad 😂
12/11/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: I meant
12/11/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: Relationship is more important than your issues. So if you have a solution, try to fix it
12/11/21, 00:54 - Tanushree: Replacement looks easy early on, but it's not in long run
12/11/21, 00:55 - Ashwin: You would think that
12/11/21, 00:55 - Ashwin: But there would be ladies for whom it would be a deal breaker?
12/11/21, 00:55 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 00:55 - Tanushree: I know kuch
12/11/21, 00:56 - Ashwin: Okay okay
12/11/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: But then it was a casual relationship
12/11/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: Who wants bad sex in casual?
12/11/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: So there is was
12/11/21, 00:56 - Ashwin: Casual relationship by definition finishes in one or 2 dates right
12/11/21, 00:56 - Tanushree: No
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: Casual relationship is when you are not thinking of long term
12/11/21, 00:57 - Ashwin: Or do people really dream about a friend's eith benefits partner
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: Is it good rn? Else you can leave easily
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: 😂
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: It can be anything really
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: You go one Tinder, find someone.
12/11/21, 00:57 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: You guys just go out, no kiss, no nothing
12/11/21, 00:57 - Tanushree: That's casual too
12/11/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: And you meet, have sex, never hang out
12/11/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: That's casual too
12/11/21, 00:58 - Ashwin: Anything goes
12/11/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Only thing common is, you aren't thinking long term
12/11/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Yes. Generally
12/11/21, 00:58 - Ashwin: This is friends
12/11/21, 00:58 - Ashwin: With benefits
12/11/21, 00:58 - Tanushree: Not really
12/11/21, 00:59 - Ashwin: Hmm
12/11/21, 00:59 - Tanushree: Two people can be interested in each other without getting physical
12/11/21, 00:59 - Tanushree: That is platonic, but still romantic
12/11/21, 00:59 - Ashwin: Yeah but platonic love is theory
12/11/21, 01:00 - Ashwin: And ultra rare
12/11/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: Nahiiiii
12/11/21, 01:00 - Ashwin: Usually it's just hesitancy
12/11/21, 01:00 - Ashwin: On people's part
12/11/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: Casual relationships are hesitancy no?
12/11/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: Else why would it be casual?
12/11/21, 01:00 - Ashwin: See
12/11/21, 01:00 - Tanushree: You don't wanna commit
12/11/21, 01:01 - Ashwin: This is exactly what I was thinking
12/11/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: It is
12/11/21, 01:01 - Ashwin: Do girls always think long term in sight
12/11/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: I personally thing people do it when they are not sure of anything 😂
12/11/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: No
12/11/21, 01:01 - Tanushree: Not ones I hang out with
12/11/21, 01:02 - Ashwin: You are equating it with hesitancy.. which means casual is just absence of commitment.
12/11/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Absence of many things
12/11/21, 01:02 - Ashwin: Which means you can't be casual for casual sake
12/11/21, 01:02 - Ashwin: There will always be thought to commit
12/11/21, 01:02 - Tanushree: Really?
12/11/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: You know your parents won't agree to your relationship
12/11/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: But you are 22
12/11/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: Of casual is hesitancy
12/11/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: If
12/11/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: 4 saal tak you wanna have something
12/11/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: So casual is good na?
12/11/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: Why would you wanna commit when you are sure?
12/11/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: So how is that casual
12/11/21, 01:03 - Ashwin: 4 years socha unhone
12/11/21, 01:03 - Tanushree: You are not thinking of taking it forward seriously
12/11/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: No
12/11/21, 01:04 - Ashwin: How isn't that long term.
12/11/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: 2 mahine chala toh bhi acha
12/11/21, 01:04 - Tanushree: Koi or mil jaana?
12/11/21, 01:04 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 01:04 - Ashwin: What I mean is
12/11/21, 01:04 - Ashwin: Kabhi aise hota
12/11/21, 01:04 - Ashwin: Ki hame sirf 2 mahine ke liye koi chahiye fur koi aur
12/11/21, 01:05 - Ashwin: Long term Bina soche as in its clear you want 2 months that's it
12/11/21, 01:05 - Tanushree: How come you don't have guy friends like that? 😂😂
12/11/21, 01:05 - Ashwin: I have guy friends
12/11/21, 01:05 - Tanushree: Who aren't into casual?
12/11/21, 01:06 - Ashwin: But I want to hear from you
12/11/21, 01:06 - Ashwin: You represent the other gender here
12/11/21, 01:06 - Tanushree: I know such women
12/11/21, 01:06 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 01:06 - Tanushree: They don't think 2 months or anything
12/11/21, 01:06 - Ashwin: With guys it's tricky it's very easy to groupthink
12/11/21, 01:06 - Tanushree: They go out, have fun without thinking anything
12/11/21, 01:06 - Tanushree: They don't mind if it goes forward or not
12/11/21, 01:07 - Tanushree: As long as it is going good
12/11/21, 01:07 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 01:07 - Tanushree: Good as in, fun
12/11/21, 01:07 - Ashwin: Yeah I gotcha
12/11/21, 01:08 - Ashwin: But what I mean us do they go with an intention of one night stand or not. Like there us absolutely no scope of any further thing.
12/11/21, 01:08 - Tanushree: Very few do it
12/11/21, 01:08 - Tanushree: But yes
12/11/21, 01:08 - Tanushree: They do
12/11/21, 01:08 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 01:08 - Tanushree: Especially if he is rich or hot
12/11/21, 01:08 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 01:08 - Ashwin: What if he is rich
12/11/21, 01:08 - Tanushree: I think both genders have it sorted
12/11/21, 01:09 - Ashwin: Hot ka toh smjh aata h
12/11/21, 01:09 - Tanushree: 2 raat acha khaana, acha hotel and nice car
12/11/21, 01:09 - Ashwin: Okay 😂
12/11/21, 01:09 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
12/11/21, 01:10 - Tanushree: Meko sath leke ni jaate lekin 😭
12/11/21, 01:10 - Ashwin: You have a bf so shut up 😂
12/11/21, 01:10 - Ashwin: How
12/11/21, 01:10 - Tanushree: Meko bas piche car k daal do 😂
12/11/21, 01:10 - Tanushree: Priorities
12/11/21, 01:10 - Tanushree: I mean
12/11/21, 01:11 - Ashwin: Theek
12/11/21, 01:11 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 01:11 - Tanushree: Apko kya chaiye? 🙂
12/11/21, 01:11 - Tanushree: Itna detailed answer toh liya
12/11/21, 01:11 - Tanushree: Samjhna kya hai? 😂😂
12/11/21, 01:11 - Ashwin: Kya hoti priorities
12/11/21, 01:11 - Tanushree: Ladko ki priorities mujhe itni ni pata
12/11/21, 01:12 - Tanushree: Some are fine with any girl
12/11/21, 01:12 - Ashwin: Just trying to validate theories
12/11/21, 01:12 - Tanushree: Ladkiyo ko hot and rich
12/11/21, 01:12 - Tanushree: Haan thik hi hongi
12/11/21, 01:12 - Tanushree: Me koi rocket science toh bata ni rahi 😂
12/11/21, 01:12 - Ashwin: Would a girl have sex with a guy who is upremely hot but poor?
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 01:13 - Ashwin: Like an auto rickshaw wala
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 01:13 - Ashwin: I can imagine men doing that but not women
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: I feel ladkiya classist hoti hain
12/11/21, 01:13 - Ashwin: Exactly
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: So not really
12/11/21, 01:13 - Ashwin: They value money right
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: Not really
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: Rickshaw wale ka beta
12/11/21, 01:13 - Tanushree: Agar student ho
12/11/21, 01:14 - Tanushree: Toh wo chalega unhe
12/11/21, 01:14 - Ashwin: Hmm
12/11/21, 01:14 - Tanushree: They wanna feel they are getting a good deal
12/11/21, 01:14 - Ashwin: That's interesting
12/11/21, 01:14 - Tanushree: What they are getting is in demand
12/11/21, 01:14 - Ashwin: But that's another way to say
12/11/21, 01:14 - Tanushree: How many wanna do a rikshawala?
12/11/21, 01:14 - Ashwin: He is going to be rich
12/11/21, 01:14 - Tanushree: No
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: We aren't thinking thay
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: We aren't thinking long term
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: He is student
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: Bas
12/11/21, 01:15 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: Itna hi sochre hain
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: He is a student. I'm a student. Koi zada class difference ni yahan
12/11/21, 01:15 - Ashwin: But long term mein he has potential to be
12/11/21, 01:15 - Ashwin: Understood
12/11/21, 01:15 - Tanushree: We aren't thinking long term there
12/11/21, 01:16 - Tanushree: Bas upar upar se
12/11/21, 01:16 - Tanushree: Equal lagna chaiye
12/11/21, 01:16 - Tanushree: And thoda demand me
12/11/21, 01:16 - Tanushree: Zada bhi ni, bas thoda is good enough 😂
12/11/21, 01:16 - Ashwin: What I wanted to verify is 

That if an auto rickshaw wali girl is there who is very hot then there is an outside chance that men would still go after her 

But if an auto rickshaw wala guy is there supremely hot but poor it would not be the same response from women
12/11/21, 01:16 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
12/11/21, 01:17 - Tanushree: True
12/11/21, 01:17 - Ashwin: Okay 👌
12/11/21, 01:17 - Tanushree: Women want someone who is equal to them
12/11/21, 01:17 - Ashwin: So its basically for using simpler term money/standing
12/11/21, 01:17 - Tanushree: Usually
12/11/21, 01:17 - Ashwin: Or better
12/11/21, 01:17 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 01:18 - Ashwin: Men can go below too
12/11/21, 01:18 - Tanushree: Yes 😂
12/11/21, 01:18 - Tanushree: Men have no standards sometimes
12/11/21, 01:18 - Ashwin: Huh I was thinking that
12/11/21, 01:18 - Tanushree: Many men don't (sorry I'm sounding crap) 😂
12/11/21, 01:18 - Ashwin: No you dont
12/11/21, 01:18 - Ashwin: You say whatever
12/11/21, 01:18 - Ashwin: Men don't have standards
12/11/21, 01:19 - Ashwin: That's very true
12/11/21, 01:19 - Ashwin: This I know
12/11/21, 01:20 - Ashwin: I have a sneaking suspicion that I might be living my life wrong, and there is definitely space to experiment
12/11/21, 01:20 - Tanushree: 😂
12/11/21, 01:20 - Tanushree: As in
12/11/21, 01:21 - Ashwin: I needed to test my 'compatibility'
12/11/21, 01:21 - Tanushree: With whom
12/11/21, 01:21 - Ashwin: Now I have morphed into this being who just runs away from any intimacy
12/11/21, 01:21 - Ashwin: Rather than run away I don't have the drive
12/11/21, 01:22 - Ashwin: Anyone. We don't have standards
12/11/21, 01:22 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 01:22 - Ashwin: Thanks!
12/11/21, 01:22 - Tanushree: For long term
12/11/21, 01:22 - Tanushree: Women usually like men who have standards 😂
12/11/21, 01:23 - Ashwin: And experience
12/11/21, 01:23 - Tanushree: Not really
12/11/21, 01:23 - Tanushree: 😂
12/11/21, 01:23 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 01:23 - Tanushree: You don't have itna time
12/11/21, 01:23 - Tanushree: To know it all 😂
12/11/21, 01:23 - Tanushree: Or maybe you do
12/11/21, 01:23 - Tanushree: Who am I to judge 😂

12/11/21, 02:11 - Tanushree: But rather in a way, which helps their agenda
12/11/21, 02:12 - Ashwin: Based on their limited heteronormal patriarchal understanding yes

12/11/21, 02:15 - Ashwin: So you can't consider me as date?
12/11/21, 02:15 - Ashwin: Even hypothetically

12/11/21, 10:59 - Tanushree: Meko laga ki thik h, utha shy laga toh ni
12/11/21, 10:59 - Tanushree: But she knows better
12/11/21, 10:59 - Ashwin: So what is your evaluation
12/11/21, 11:00 - Ashwin: Same here
12/11/21, 11:00 - Tanushree: You aren't really shy
12/11/21, 11:00 - Tanushree: Maybe awkward
12/11/21, 11:00 - Tanushree: And ya reserved
12/11/21, 11:04 - Ashwin: That's worse 😭🤣

12/11/21, 11:05 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂😂
12/11/21, 11:05 - Tanushree: You seem awkward sometimes
12/11/21, 11:05 - Tanushree: That's it
12/11/21, 11:08 - Ashwin: Howwww

12/11/21, 11:10 - Ashwin: Not one of your boys
12/11/21, 11:10 - Tanushree: 🤢
12/11/21, 11:10 - Ashwin: But tell me where I was awkward mama
12/11/21, 11:10 - Tanushree: Sometimes you seem
12/11/21, 11:10 - Tanushree: Like not any incident specifically
12/11/21, 11:11 - Tanushree: But sometimes it seems you are blushing 😂
12/11/21, 11:11 - Tanushree: Which maybe bcoz you are embarrassed of something or idk
12/11/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: Sorry I was speaking to my fav senior
12/11/21, 11:13 - Tanushree: Awww
12/11/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
12/11/21, 11:13 - Tanushree: I didn't know I'm your favourite
12/11/21, 11:13 - Tanushree: 🥰
12/11/21, 11:13 - Ashwin: He has been such a good mentor to me 🥰
12/11/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: Blushing? 😅😅
12/11/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: Embarrassed
12/11/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: Yeah I am maybe sometimes
12/11/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: Codes ki baatein hi karte aap harr jagh? 🙂
12/11/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: Haan isliye
12/11/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: Lagta hoga
12/11/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: Awkward hore
12/11/21, 11:14 - Ashwin: But would love it if you gave me a situation
12/11/21, 11:14 - Tanushree: But then I can't pin point exactly when
12/11/21, 11:15 - Tanushree: I don't notice it like that 😂
12/11/21, 11:15 - Tanushree: Subtle hota h
12/11/21, 11:15 - Tanushree: Plus you know I'm usually so hyped, I barely notice the subtleties
12/11/21, 11:16 - Tanushree: But usually I feel so. Not due to a specific reason. Just your body language and the way you talk for a while
12/11/21, 11:16 - Ashwin: Yeahh
12/11/21, 11:17 - Ashwin: I also notice sometimes
12/11/21, 11:17 - Ashwin: Like
12/11/21, 11:17 - Ashwin: When I am not talking you would look at me as if something was wrong
12/11/21, 11:17 - Ashwin: Though at that time nothing was wrong
12/11/21, 11:17 - Ashwin: Thats just my "resting bitch face" in saumyas words
12/11/21, 11:18 - Tanushree: ??? 😂
12/11/21, 11:18 - Tanushree: Achaa?
12/11/21, 11:18 - Ashwin: But I thought everybody was like that. Like they'll have period of awkwardness
12/11/21, 11:18 - Tanushree: I usually notice other people. But forget to notice myself
12/11/21, 11:18 - Tanushree: Not really
12/11/21, 11:18 - Ashwin: You never ever
12/11/21, 11:18 - Ashwin: Ever ever ever
12/11/21, 11:18 - Ashwin: Feel awkward
12/11/21, 11:18 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: I do
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: But
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: It shows more clearly in your case
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: Than others
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: Bassss
12/11/21, 11:19 - Ashwin: Ohh
12/11/21, 11:19 - Ashwin: Should I work on it
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: Naah
12/11/21, 11:19 - Ashwin: 🤣
12/11/21, 11:19 - Tanushree: Nothing wrong with it
12/11/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: But sometimes I do become awkward just like that
12/11/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: If I have to be in conversation with someone for a long time
12/11/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: But in a group I am better
12/11/21, 11:20 - Ashwin: Because I can simply observe and do tippanni from time to time
12/11/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: Lots of reserved people do stay silent
12/11/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: Kafi subtle hota h
12/11/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: But it seems like they are thinkinh
12/11/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: Toh itna pata ni lagta I guess
12/11/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: And since we aren't in a group
12/11/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: I seem like panikonh
12/11/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: I tend to notice more
12/11/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: I also notice I am awkward
12/11/21, 11:21 - Tanushree: Then why are you asking for proof? 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:21 - Ashwin: Then I have to get out of whatever I was thinking
12/11/21, 11:22 - Ashwin: I wanted to know how obvious it was 😂
12/11/21, 11:22 - Tanushree: You can ask others 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:22 - Tanushree: I tend to notice more.
12/11/21, 11:22 - Tanushree: Usually ni notice karte 😂
12/11/21, 11:22 - Ashwin: I never get awkward with male friends
12/11/21, 11:22 - Tanushree: Woahhhhh
12/11/21, 11:23 - Ashwin: Even if I am I don't notice or care
12/11/21, 11:23 - Tanushree: Now don't blame it on me bitch
12/11/21, 11:23 - Tanushree: 🙂
12/11/21, 11:23 - Ashwin: You are to be blamed dog
12/11/21, 11:23 - Ashwin: Dawg
12/11/21, 11:23 - Tanushree: Sahi h
12/11/21, 11:23 - Tanushree: Dusro p daal do ☺️
12/11/21, 11:23 - Ashwin: Learned from the best 😌
12/11/21, 11:23 - Tanushree: ☺️☺️☺️
12/11/21, 11:23 - Tanushree: Also
12/11/21, 11:24 - Tanushree: You seem like you are trying to look put together
12/11/21, 11:24 - Tanushree: Huh
12/11/21, 11:24 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:24 - Ashwin: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:24 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 11:24 - Tanushree: I wasn't saying in a bad way
12/11/21, 11:24 - Ashwin: Like what dies this mean
12/11/21, 11:24 - Ashwin: No it sounded all sorts of bad
12/11/21, 11:24 - Ashwin: I love it
12/11/21, 11:24 - Ashwin: But how
12/11/21, 11:24 - Tanushree: With this it did
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: Realised later
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:25 - Ashwin: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: Idk
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: Your body language seems less confident than you let on show
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: Idk
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: If it makes sense
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:25 - Ashwin: Yeah it does
12/11/21, 11:25 - Tanushree: Bcoz I can't give evidence
12/11/21, 11:26 - Ashwin: But does it mean I try to show myself as more confident
12/11/21, 11:26 - Tanushree: I'm not saying that
12/11/21, 11:26 - Tanushree: I just feel
12/11/21, 11:26 - Tanushree: You don't really 'feel' as confident
12/11/21, 11:26 - Tanushree: Like your body language is not of confidence
12/11/21, 11:26 - Ashwin: Because what I ve realized it is that. I have really small pockets of confidence. When I talk about stuff I know.
12/11/21, 11:26 - Tanushree: Lekin your behaviour is
12/11/21, 11:27 - Tanushree: Your talk and behave fine
12/11/21, 11:27 - Tanushree: But your body language is a bit different
12/11/21, 11:27 - Tanushree: Less confident
12/11/21, 11:27 - Ashwin: But then I don't have much experience with interaction with girls too, so sometimes that shows in my body language 🤷
12/11/21, 11:27 - Tanushree: 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
12/11/21, 11:27 - Ashwin: Is my theory
12/11/21, 11:27 - Tanushree: Why are you putting it on me ☺️
12/11/21, 11:28 - Ashwin: But thanks for bringing it to my notice
12/11/21, 11:28 - Tanushree: You don't have to think of me as a girl ☺️
12/11/21, 11:28 - Tanushree: What's the difference
12/11/21, 11:28 - Ashwin: It feels like I am figuring things out
12/11/21, 11:28 - Ashwin: No that's nit how it works
12/11/21, 11:29 - Tanushree: So mere pajame me aane ka koi faida ni hua?
12/11/21, 11:29 - Tanushree: Huh 🙂
12/11/21, 11:29 - Ashwin: I have been out with a girl muskie se 10 times

12/11/21, 11:46 - Tanushree: You can literally blame your awkwardness on me now
12/11/21, 11:46 - Tanushree: 😂😂

12/11/21, 11:48 - Ashwin: But you don't make me that awkward
12/11/21, 11:48 - Ashwin: Because somehow my social threshold of facing flak is high
12/11/21, 11:48 - Tanushree: I didn't even lick plates with you?
12/11/21, 11:48 - Ashwin: Like you speak very loudly and fast people would then look at you judge eyes but that normal
12/11/21, 11:49 - Tanushree: People look at me when I talk? Never noticed😂😂
12/11/21, 11:49 - Ashwin: Unless you blurt out something really explosive

12/11/21, 11:50 - Tanushree: God
12/11/21, 11:50 - Tanushree: Men get embarrased of that too
12/11/21, 11:50 - Tanushree: Ugh
12/11/21, 11:50 - Ashwin: In metro people tend to hear gossip
12/11/21, 11:50 - Ashwin: And I would get it
12/11/21, 11:50 - Ashwin: Like it's not what you do at restaurants
12/11/21, 11:50 - Ashwin: Licking plates
12/11/21, 11:50 - Tanushree: Oh 😂😂😂😂
12/11/21, 11:50 - Tanushree: I do there also
12/11/21, 11:51 - Ashwin: Where
12/11/21, 11:51 - Ashwin: Do what
12/11/21, 11:51 - Tanushree: Lick plates at restuarants
12/11/21, 11:51 - Ashwin: That toh you said
12/11/21, 11:52 - Ashwin: And I know for a fact that you do
12/11/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: ?
12/11/21, 11:52 - Ashwin: It not generally accepted behaviour
12/11/21, 11:52 - Ashwin: I was talking from your boys perspective
12/11/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: Hm
12/11/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: I didn't know before
12/11/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: I thought, kya farak padta h
12/11/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: Unki thodi chatri
12/11/21, 11:52 - Tanushree: 😢
12/11/21, 11:53 - Ashwin: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:53 - Ashwin: See that's why I can't understand you
12/11/21, 11:53 - Ashwin: One moment like a child
12/11/21, 11:53 - Ashwin: Next all grown up
12/11/21, 11:53 - Tanushree: If i act like a child all the time, who will handle me? 😂
12/11/21, 11:53 - Tanushree: And being grown up all the time is tough
12/11/21, 11:53 - Ashwin: So you know
12/11/21, 11:53 - Tanushree: So I keep switching
12/11/21, 11:54 - Ashwin: You knew
12/11/21, 11:54 - Tanushree: Why can't a grown up lick their plate?
12/11/21, 11:54 - Tanushree: I didn't know it was a big deal
12/11/21, 11:54 - Tanushree: Until it was 😂
12/11/21, 11:54 - Ashwin: 😂😂
12/11/21, 11:54 - Ashwin: But you know
12/11/21, 11:54 - Ashwin: Right
12/11/21, 11:54 - Tanushree: Yaa
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: See
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: That's what
12/11/21, 11:55 - Tanushree: Now I do
12/11/21, 11:55 - Tanushree: Hard way
12/11/21, 11:55 - Tanushree: 🥲
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: You want to act like a child
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: Earlier too
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: Though you know fully well the behaviour
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: Expected in social situations
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: The thing I don't get is
12/11/21, 11:55 - Ashwin: I mean every thing is understandable
12/11/21, 11:56 - Ashwin: Except for why you cried that day when talking about results
12/11/21, 11:56 - Ashwin: Now one can't conjure up tears like that no
12/11/21, 11:56 - Ashwin: You must have felt some emotional distress
12/11/21, 11:57 - Ashwin: But usually a "grown up" wouldn't have cried at that particular moment unless it was utter surprise or some unexpected like that
12/11/21, 11:57 - Tanushree: I was sad about that
12/11/21, 11:57 - Ashwin: That's why I found that very cute
12/11/21, 11:57 - Ashwin: Like a child
12/11/21, 11:57 - Ashwin: Rest all can be attributed to a behaviour where you want to be petulant like a child
12/11/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: But at that moment you were childish
12/11/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: 🌝🐣
12/11/21, 11:58 - Tanushree: Idk
12/11/21, 11:58 - Tanushree: Maybe
12/11/21, 11:58 - Tanushree: Grownups can cry over low marks too
12/11/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: They whine and complaint
12/11/21, 11:58 - Ashwin: Not literally cry
12/11/21, 11:59 - Ashwin: Unless they fail 🥲
12/11/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: I have a C grade
12/11/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: In a subject which is going to be my PhD specialisation
12/11/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: 😢
12/11/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: Equivalent
12/11/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: Idk
12/11/21, 11:59 - Tanushree: Probably
12/11/21, 11:59 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: I have been told this before. I act like a child
12/11/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: But idk
12/11/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: I don't think so
12/11/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: I sometimes behave like one
12/11/21, 12:00 - Ashwin: Act is different
12/11/21, 12:00 - Ashwin: And being is different
12/11/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: But crying is naturally adult
12/11/21, 12:00 - Ashwin: It's natural
12/11/21, 12:00 - Ashwin: But long suppressed
12/11/21, 12:00 - Tanushree: Pata ni
12/11/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: You'll see me often
12/11/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: Just see how often I cry at anything 😂
12/11/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: Idk if it's childish
12/11/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: But happens
12/11/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: My emotion regulation is not very good
12/11/21, 12:01 - Tanushree: Can't control too well.
12/11/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: See it's very adult to know this stuff
12/11/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: But still doing it anyway for no apparent benefit
12/11/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: Is childish
12/11/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: No I was telling you na
12/11/21, 12:02 - Ashwin: But its not a bad thing
12/11/21, 12:02 - Tanushree: My emotional state is very transparent
12/11/21, 12:03 - Tanushree: Bilkul pata lagta h
12/11/21, 12:03 - Tanushree: What I'm feeling
12/11/21, 12:03 - Tanushree: So similar for crying also
12/11/21, 12:03 - Ashwin: Apparently mine too
12/11/21, 12:03 - Ashwin: People know when I feel awkward
12/11/21, 12:03 - Tanushree: What happened to the resting bitch face? 😂😂
12/11/21, 12:03 - Ashwin: Wahi toh flaw h
12/11/21, 12:03 - Tanushree: Who else said before?
12/11/21, 12:03 - Ashwin: Poker face nhi h
12/11/21, 12:04 - Ashwin: I sense it
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: Maybe that made you awkeard 😂
12/11/21, 12:04 - Ashwin: Yesss
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: Otherwise you feel awkward with women
12/11/21, 12:04 - Ashwin: That is true
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: And you haven't met that many
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: Sooooo
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: How do you know
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: If other people are sensing it or not
12/11/21, 12:04 - Tanushree: In such little time
12/11/21, 12:05 - Ashwin: I sense it and then it's a vicious cycle
12/11/21, 12:05 - Ashwin: I don't care too much about the other person sometimes sometimes it's like internal dialogue
12/11/21, 12:06 - Ashwin: Kya jar rha h ashwin. Ye jyun bola etc
12/11/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: Haan 😂
12/11/21, 12:06 - Tanushree: Ye ho sakta h

12/11/21, 13:01 - Tanushree: https://education.ki.se/assessing-equivalent-knowledge-for-general-eligibility-for-doctoral-education
12/11/21, 13:02 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
12/11/21, 13:02 - Tanushree: Like if I have a non-submitted scientific paper, what should I get attested? Where?
12/11/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 13:46 - Ashwin: Okay will see
12/11/21, 13:48 - Tanushree: What is funny? 😢
12/11/21, 14:08 - Ashwin: Do you have has been awarded a degree at the advanced (second-cycle) level
12/11/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: What is this?
12/11/21, 14:08 - Ashwin: And.. has satisfied the requirements for courses comprising at least 240 credits of which at least 60 credits were awarded at the advanced level, or
12/11/21, 14:08 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: Okah then 3rd point isn't valid for you
12/11/21, 14:09 - Ashwin: Let's read the rest
12/11/21, 14:09 - Tanushree: Office over apka?
12/11/21, 14:10 - Ashwin: Nhi
12/11/21, 14:10 - Ashwin: Full day right
12/11/21, 14:10 - Tanushree: Ya on weekend
12/11/21, 14:10 - Ashwin: What they mean is
12/11/21, 14:11 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
12/11/21, 14:13 - Tanushree: Ek sec
12/11/21, 14:13 - Tanushree: I'll be more specific
12/11/21, 14:16 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
12/11/21, 14:19 - Ashwin: Lead authorship of a non-submitted scientific paper:

Print out of manuscript with attestation of the author list by the supervisor (or similar)
12/11/21, 14:19 - Ashwin: Very clear take a print out of your unsubmitted manuscript
12/11/21, 14:19 - Ashwin: And get it signed by the mentor so that they understand that you are the lead contributor for the paper
12/11/21, 14:20 - Ashwin: Someone else would be a person
12/11/21, 14:20 - Tanushree: What is meant by the manuscript here?
12/11/21, 14:20 - Ashwin: Who has some standing I  the community/ has published papers
12/11/21, 14:20 - Ashwin: Manuscript is the draft that you want to submit
12/11/21, 14:20 - Ashwin: Of your research
12/11/21, 14:21 - Ashwin: Research paper basically
12/11/21, 14:21 - Tanushree: If the paper is not published and submited
12/11/21, 14:21 - Tanushree: That means I can't send it to other people right?
12/11/21, 14:21 - Tanushree: Bcoz it's not submitted
12/11/21, 14:21 - Ashwin: Is there a sneaky clause like that
12/11/21, 14:21 - Ashwin: I don't think so
12/11/21, 14:21 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 14:21 - Ashwin: But the thing is they can derive work out of your manuscript
12/11/21, 14:22 - Ashwin: That's the only trouble
12/11/21, 14:22 - Tanushree: You don't send your papers to anyone before publication
12/11/21, 14:22 - Ashwin: Then that's a paradox
12/11/21, 14:22 - Tanushree: Bcoz they might publish it
12/11/21, 14:22 - Ashwin: How would you get it published then
12/11/21, 14:22 - Tanushree: Yahi toh samjh ni aara
12/11/21, 14:22 - Ashwin: There are greater dangers
12/11/21, 14:22 - Tanushree: You only send it for the review
12/11/21, 14:22 - Ashwin: Haan toh how do you trust your reviewers
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: In similar capacity you need to trust the faculty or
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: Read the fine print
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: I ma sure there would be legal terms binding to the submission process
12/11/21, 14:23 - Tanushree: No
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: No
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: 😂
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: Okay
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: Then you know better
12/11/21, 14:23 - Tanushree: It's very confusing
12/11/21, 14:23 - Ashwin: It's not
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: I can't even fill the application
12/11/21, 14:24 - Ashwin: Just send the manuscript
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: I can't
12/11/21, 14:24 - Ashwin: With attestation required as proof
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: We can't send it before publication
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: Only the supervisor can.
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: But they won't
12/11/21, 14:24 - Ashwin: So that's why
12/11/21, 14:24 - Ashwin: The attestation
12/11/21, 14:24 - Ashwin: They won't then okay
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: See
12/11/21, 14:24 - Ashwin: That's between you and the supervisor
12/11/21, 14:24 - Tanushree: Apne jo paper likha tha
12/11/21, 14:25 - Tanushree: Publish hone se pehle
12/11/21, 14:25 - Tanushree: Aap bhej dete kisi ko bhi?
12/11/21, 14:25 - Ashwin: Haan 😂
12/11/21, 14:25 - Tanushree: ☺️
12/11/21, 14:25 - Ashwin: We just wanted it to get published
12/11/21, 14:25 - Tanushree: That's how Watson and Crick stole the dna
12/11/21, 14:25 - Ashwin: You are saying your work is that revolutionary
12/11/21, 14:26 - Tanushree: Never share the paper before publication
12/11/21, 14:26 - Ashwin: I am not undermining it's importance
12/11/21, 14:26 - Tanushree: It's either publish or perish
12/11/21, 14:26 - Ashwin: But I kind of am
12/11/21, 14:26 - Tanushree: Very very competitive
12/11/21, 14:26 - Ashwin: Yhi rat laga li
12/11/21, 14:26 - Ashwin: Toh then simple
12/11/21, 14:26 - Tanushree: It doesn't matter if it's relevant or not
12/11/21, 14:26 - Ashwin: Apply for this position
12/11/21, 14:26 - Tanushree: People are not publishing papers to change the world
12/11/21, 14:26 - Ashwin: After you have a pu location to your name
12/11/21, 14:26 - Tanushree: They are doing it to maintain their tenure
12/11/21, 14:27 - Tanushree: Pu?
12/11/21, 14:27 - Ashwin: Publication
12/11/21, 14:27 - Tanushree: 😌😌
12/11/21, 14:27 - Ashwin: 🙂🙂
12/11/21, 14:27 - Tanushree: Okayy
12/11/21, 14:27 - Ashwin: Really
12/11/21, 14:27 - Ashwin: That was the solution?
12/11/21, 14:28 - Tanushree: No
12/11/21, 14:28 - Ashwin: Then
12/11/21, 14:28 - Tanushree: You are not from academia
12/11/21, 14:28 - Tanushree: You don't know
12/11/21, 14:28 - Ashwin: Huh
12/11/21, 14:28 - Ashwin: So it was emoji highbrowing
12/11/21, 14:28 - Tanushree: I'll have to ask my supervisor
12/11/21, 14:28 - Tanushree: Last time she said
12/11/21, 14:28 - Ashwin: That's what she said
12/11/21, 14:28 - Tanushree: No they can't ask for the unpublished paper
12/11/21, 14:29 - Tanushree: That illegal
12/11/21, 14:29 - Tanushree: So I guess they are not asking for the paper
12/11/21, 14:29 - Tanushree: They are asking for something else
12/11/21, 14:29 - Ashwin: Okay hmmmm
12/11/21, 14:29 - Tanushree: Maybe literature review, maybe abstract
12/11/21, 14:29 - Ashwin: I thought they are asking for a draft
12/11/21, 14:29 - Tanushree: I have mailed them. No replies
12/11/21, 14:29 - Ashwin: Accha
12/11/21, 14:29 - Ashwin: Toh itna toh nhi malum mujhe
12/11/21, 14:30 - Tanushree: It's fine
12/11/21, 14:30 - Tanushree: Confusing kafi
12/11/21, 14:30 - Tanushree: I'll have to look for someone
12/11/21, 14:30 - Tanushree: Who has applied outside
12/11/21, 14:30 - Ashwin: Especially for people
✌️not from academia ✌️
12/11/21, 14:30 - Ashwin: Yes please
12/11/21, 14:31 - Ashwin: An engineer can only do so much
12/11/21, 14:31 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/11/21, 14:31 - Tanushree: You have published papers
12/11/21, 14:31 - Ashwin: Which are essentially plagiarised
12/11/21, 14:31 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
12/11/21, 14:32 - Ashwin: Well :)
12/11/21, 14:32 - Tanushree: I know
12/11/21, 14:32 - Tanushree: My engineer friend was proudly telling me
12/11/21, 14:32 - Tanushree: Ieee me publish hua h
12/11/21, 14:32 - Tanushree: Then he told me kese 
5 papers lo. Thoda thoda change karke combine kardo 😂😂
12/11/21, 14:32 - Tanushree: I was baffled 😂😂😂
12/11/21, 14:38 - Ashwin: I am baffled that you are baffled
12/11/21, 14:38 - Ashwin: It was really common sense
12/11/21, 14:45 - Tanushree: Nahi, I didn't know. I thought kafi scientific hoga kuch 😂
12/11/21, 14:45 - Tanushree: Log bas essay ki tarah likhenge papers, laga ni tha tab
12/11/21, 14:54 - Ashwin: It's how it is
12/11/21, 14:55 - Ashwin: Who feeded you with so much rigor about papers and ethics and stuff
12/11/21, 14:55 - Tanushree: Cbcs
12/11/21, 14:55 - Tanushree: 🥲
12/11/21, 14:55 - Tanushree: We follow ethics very seriously.
12/11/21, 14:56 - Ashwin: Ghanta mera
12/11/21, 14:56 - Tanushree: But ya, I have seen other people's work. Other universities, even IITs. Crap work, crap ethics and sooo many design flaws
12/11/21, 14:56 - Ashwin: I am sure
12/11/21, 14:57 - Ashwin: Wherever subjective evaluation is there
12/11/21, 14:57 - Tanushree: Not all. But kuch ko dekha
12/11/21, 14:57 - Ashwin: People will plagiarize
12/11/21, 14:57 - Tanushree: Subjective evaluation kya hota h?
12/11/21, 14:57 - Ashwin: You speak from a high pedestal
12/11/21, 14:58 - Ashwin: As in there is no evaluation. And objective evaluation is based on results that are hard facts
12/11/21, 14:58 - Tanushree: Jab you are writing literature review, you HAVE TO write what the paper was saying na. You can't write anything else
12/11/21, 14:58 - Tanushree: Hard facts me you can't plagiarise. You can tamper the data but not copy
12/11/21, 14:59 - Ashwin: Maybe you take it seriously but pretty sure other dont
12/11/21, 14:59 - Ashwin: Especially in india

12/11/21, 15:10 - Tanushree: I'm not handling it. She is from bio. Has no idea about cognitive studies and even designing
12/11/21, 15:10 - Tanushree: She will take time to learn
12/11/21, 15:10 - Tanushree: I'm assuming she will change many things
12/11/21, 15:10 - Tanushree: She was discussing with maam
12/11/21, 15:11 - Tanushree: She wanna collect blood samples, saliva sample, blah blah samples as variables
12/11/21, 15:11 - Tanushree: She wanna make it more biological.
12/11/21, 15:11 - Tanushree: Depends on budget

12/11/21, 15:12 - Ashwin: But what about visual stimuli
12/11/21, 15:12 - Tanushree: They are making it more complex than ut alreafy is
12/11/21, 15:13 - Ashwin: So she would study based on food how much saliva I produce
12/11/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: They wanna check neuro inflammation in the brain centers
12/11/21, 15:13 - Ashwin: This looks nice but how to record it
12/11/21, 15:13 - Ashwin: You need the Frankensteins helmet
12/11/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: Ther are certain blood markers
12/11/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: Sorry
12/11/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: Biomarkers

12/11/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: They will manage
12/11/21, 15:14 - Ashwin: I am sure that it's not as simple or scalable as a program
12/11/21, 15:14 - Ashwin: Even biomarkers need particular sensors right
12/11/21, 15:14 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 15:14 - Ashwin: Si they would have yo vonductvit at some place
12/11/21, 15:14 - Tanushree: They are trying to get pathlabs involved
12/11/21, 15:14 - Ashwin: One batch at atime
12/11/21, 15:15 - Tanushree: Like they were discussing all this
12/11/21, 15:15 - Ashwin: The biggest advantage of your project was that it was distrutable
12/11/21, 15:15 - Tanushree: Meko toh kafi mehnga and complicated laga 😂
12/11/21, 15:15 - Ashwin: To people at their home

12/11/21, 15:15 - Tanushree: Ab or itne add karne
12/11/21, 15:15 - Tanushree: No no
12/11/21, 15:15 - Tanushree: It was just neuroimaging
12/11/21, 15:16 - Tanushree: I don't get into the structural parts of anything
12/11/21, 15:16 - Tanushree: Just how anything fuctions
12/11/21, 15:16 - Ashwin: Understood
12/11/21, 15:16 - Tanushree: Neuropsychology part
12/11/21, 15:16 - Ashwin: But it was something people could do from anywhere right
12/11/21, 15:16 - Tanushree: Since she is from bio
12/11/21, 15:16 - Tanushree: She is trying to make it pure neuro
12/11/21, 15:17 - Tanushree: That happens when new people join in mid
12/11/21, 15:17 - Tanushree: The vision changes
12/11/21, 15:17 - Tanushree: Yes
12/11/21, 15:17 - Tanushree: Lekin I'm not from bio, so hard to tell
12/11/21, 15:17 - Ashwin: I know biosensors they are expensive
12/11/21, 15:17 - Ashwin: You can t make one just like that
12/11/21, 15:18 - Ashwin: Unless you has raspberry pi
12/11/21, 15:18 - Tanushree: Pata ni ye log exactly kese sochre
12/11/21, 15:18 - Tanushree: Kuki us din kafi superficial discussion tji
12/11/21, 15:18 - Ashwin: This project would need deep pockets
12/11/21, 15:18 - Ashwin: And support from higher administration
12/11/21, 15:18 - Tanushree: And she is very good at convincing
12/11/21, 15:18 - Tanushree: So she was telling zada mehnga ni hoga

12/13/21, 13:39 - Tanushree: Btw I talked to my supervisor regarding attestation stuff
12/13/21, 13:40 - Tanushree: And she said she isn't comfortable sharing. If your other paper isn't relevant to your career, you may.
But she won't recommend it from her side 😂
12/13/21, 13:40 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
12/13/21, 13:41 - Ashwin: Okay
12/13/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: Baffling right 😂
12/13/21, 13:41 - Ashwin: Expected response
12/13/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: Haan
12/13/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: Everyone outside academia would say
12/13/21, 13:41 - Ashwin: Now what
12/13/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: Aree likha hua h na, kardo share
12/13/21, 13:41 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/13/21, 13:42 - Tanushree: I'll ask my other supervisor. She was just a year older to me and her work ethics was super lame.
So I said to her 😂😂
So we prefer not to interact
12/13/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: Okay but now she is useful
12/13/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: Publish your paper first
12/13/21, 13:45 - Ashwin: Then send
12/13/21, 13:46 - Tanushree: It's in process for a year now
12/13/21, 13:46 - Tanushree: Pata ni kab hoga 😂
12/13/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: I sometimes feel I'll be bitch when I'll be a supervisor. I'm too strict and blunt for anyone to like
12/13/21, 13:47 - Tanushree: I wonder if I'm dissatisfied with my supervisor, is it them or me 😂
12/13/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: It's definitely you
12/13/21, 13:49 - Ashwin: But the bold you
12/13/21, 13:49 - Tanushree: I feel it's a disadvantage yaar
12/13/21, 13:50 - Tanushree: Other people also complain and cry. But when I take the same issues to the professor, they sugar coat the fuck outta it
12/13/21, 13:50 - Tanushree: As if I'm the only one with complains 😂😂
12/13/21, 13:51 - Ashwin: There's is much trickery involved
12/13/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: God knows
12/13/21, 13:51 - Tanushree: Being submissive is pretty cool I guess
12/13/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: Everything is cool
12/13/21, 13:52 - Ashwin: At appropriate times
12/13/21, 13:52 - Tanushree: Yaaa
12/13/21, 13:52 - Tanushree: I'm yet to come across a time where I feel, wow it's so cool being dominating opiniated 😂
12/13/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: Because then you don't realise but you feel cool all the time.
12/13/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: Only self aware people are uncool
12/13/21, 13:53 - Ashwin: I've noticed
12/13/21, 13:53 - Tanushree: Matlab?
12/13/21, 13:54 - Ashwin: When you are self aware and aware of the effect you have around on people, then you start to overthink
12/13/21, 13:55 - Ashwin: People who don't think about anything and just go with the flow are the conventionally cool people anyway
12/13/21, 13:55 - Tanushree: I think alot. But mostly more than about what will hurt, I overthink about what should be said. 
Overthinking toh dono jagh hain 😂
12/13/21, 13:58 - Ashwin: Then it would be cruel to be dominating anyway
12/13/21, 13:58 - Tanushree: As in?
12/13/21, 13:59 - Tanushree: And yes, I tend to get cruel at times 🥲
12/13/21, 18:10 - Ashwin: I am not suggesting you are cruel but rather why qould you be dominating if you overthink what other people think
12/13/21, 18:10 - Ashwin: It's slightly oxymoronic
12/13/21, 18:11 - Ashwin: Sushi khani mereko
12/13/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: https://youtube.com/shorts/vysekkau6AI?feature=share
12/13/21, 20:32 - Tanushree: Batao ese hote hain ladke 🙂🙂🙂🙂
12/13/21, 20:33 - Tanushree: Or ek mere aage piche hain chutiya ladke. Jo zakir ka bekar standup dekhke sushi ko bina khaye tatti declare kar chuke hain 🙂🙂🙂
12/13/21, 20:36 - Tanushree: I overthink about the balance mostly. People do stupid things all the time, but when is the time to actually comment on that
And in which tone.
12/13/21, 20:37 - Tanushree: Wo vishkha was saying na, data milna is urgent. So me sab chokde karke leke gayi aaj.
But she was busy with ethical forms. Reasonable
12/13/21, 20:40 - Tanushree: But then working hour me 2 hr seniors k sath chali gayi. Now she herself rushed me into working when I have other things to do.
12/13/21, 20:41 - Tanushree: Ab I'm leaving my work to do what she said was urgent but turns out it's not that urgent. Over time, these small small things other people tend to forget, but I kinda don't.
12/13/21, 20:42 - Ashwin: Wow you are in a mood
12/13/21, 20:42 - Ashwin: 😂
12/13/21, 20:42 - Tanushree: No
12/13/21, 20:43 - Tanushree: 😂
12/13/21, 20:43 - Tanushree: That's me everytime
12/13/21, 20:43 - Ashwin: Aage piche gloom rhe my boys. Itna toh leeway do
12/13/21, 20:43 - Ashwin: Ohh yeah. Me too. I replay scenarios in my head.
12/13/21, 20:43 - Tanushree: Nopie nopie 🥲
12/13/21, 20:44 - Tanushree: Ab apko me shayad bol du ki haan Meko bura laga
12/13/21, 20:44 - Tanushree: Lekin usko thodi jaake bolungi
12/13/21, 20:44 - Ashwin: It adds up in your book of grudge
12/13/21, 20:44 - Tanushree: And when communication is not on equal grounds, gets go wrong
12/13/21, 20:44 - Ashwin: Yeah it does
12/13/21, 20:44 - Tanushree: In my case especially 😂
Bcoz forgiving nature toh kam hi 😂
12/13/21, 20:45 - Ashwin: You don't forgive
12/13/21, 20:45 - Ashwin: Even when I don't forgive I forget
12/13/21, 20:45 - Tanushree: I forget 😂
12/13/21, 20:45 - Ashwin: Same 😂
12/13/21, 20:45 - Ashwin: It's okay
12/13/21, 20:45 - Tanushree: Haan. Lekin koi baar baar kare, toh bc kese bhulu?
12/13/21, 20:46 - Ashwin: You can tell vishakha now you have to focus on more important stuff
12/13/21, 20:46 - Tanushree: And if I don't say things to people, I feel I'm being unfair to myself and my feelings 😂
12/13/21, 20:46 - Ashwin: The  you shouldn't.  I guess that would be foolish to expect things won't repeat
12/13/21, 20:46 - Ashwin: Then it's all about whether it's worth to take the risk
12/13/21, 20:47 - Ashwin: Hmm okay that's pretty egocentric. But its a good mechanism
12/13/21, 20:47 - Tanushree: Things repeat. I get resentful
And I say things, and it gets bad
12/13/21, 20:47 - Tanushree: Haan I feel the need to respect myself in the process 😂😂
12/13/21, 20:47 - Ashwin: Be cautiously optimistic in these cases. Or just veer away altogether
12/13/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: Good boost for self esteem
12/13/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: Yaaa 1 more week
12/13/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: And I'm off
12/13/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: Woah okay
12/13/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: But break off at no hard feelings
12/13/21, 20:48 - Ashwin: Or maybe even a kiss
12/13/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: I'll forget 😂
12/13/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: Obviously
12/13/21, 20:48 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂

12/13/21, 20:49 - Tanushree: 750 calories

12/16/21, 14:36 - Ashwin: Don't worry
12/16/21, 14:36 - Ashwin: Your credentials and passion should make up for the marks

12/16/21, 15:11 - Tanushree: Kya pata. Maybe I can fall more
12/16/21, 15:11 - Tanushree: There is no communication between three offices here.
12/16/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: My own department office is saying they have nothing in their own hands. 
Printing office is saying they can't update the marksheet due to policy.

Intermediate department is saying that there is no reason why they can't update the marks. Ask them to give in writing why they can't update.
12/16/21, 15:13 - Tanushree: It's so frustration. 
They all are constantly asking me to write application forms
12/16/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: Get a letter made from your father
12/16/21, 16:03 - Ashwin: Get this in writing too
12/16/21, 16:04 - Ashwin: Sometimes you can't handle everything
12/16/21, 16:07 - Ashwin: Consult Aman for some legal measures you can take so that atleast you can mention it in passing next time you talk to them
12/16/21, 16:10 - Tanushree: I wanted to do this. But rn they are not clarifying properly if I'm get it or not. One is saying can't be done, other is saying ho jaana chaiye

12/16/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: You have a government job
12/16/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: Nd your parents don't think you are useless
12/16/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: I just want this to go away
12/16/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: Do they really think that
12/16/21, 18:57 - Ashwin: My parents same taana maarte
12/16/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: Not useless
12/16/21, 18:57 - Tanushree: But my father has said it
12/16/21, 18:58 - Tanushree: He doesn't think I have ever done anything which will make him proud
12/16/21, 18:58 - Tanushree: We have always been just mediocre
12/16/21, 18:59 - Ashwin: Ms Dhoni also in the movie in flight said ab tak Maine kuch nhi kiya for being famous
12/16/21, 18:59 - Ashwin: It's not about what you have done
12/16/21, 18:59 - Ashwin: It's about potential
12/16/21, 18:59 - Ashwin: It is independent of which university you attend
12/16/21, 18:59 - Tanushree: I don't have that too
12/16/21, 18:59 - Tanushree: Warna abhi tak kar leti na
12/16/21, 18:59 - Ashwin: You have the potential
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: That's why you are still trying
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: And fighting despite all these odds
12/16/21, 19:00 - Tanushree: Nahi
12/16/21, 19:00 - Tanushree: I will give up
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: Finally of you do succeed and are proud of yourseld
12/16/21, 19:00 - Tanushree: Once I leave for hydrabad
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: That's enough
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: Not marksheet
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: But in life
12/16/21, 19:00 - Tanushree: Me being proud of myself isn't enough na 🥲
12/16/21, 19:00 - Ashwin: Of going to a better place
12/16/21, 19:01 - Ashwin: It's the first step
12/16/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: Pata ni
12/16/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: Guess so
12/16/21, 19:01 - Ashwin: You'll definitely go to a good place
12/16/21, 19:01 - Tanushree: Not good enough
12/16/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: You can also go from there with experience
12/16/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: There is no set criterion for good enough
12/16/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: Being an officer also is not good enough
12/16/21, 19:02 - Tanushree: There is for my father 😂
12/16/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: Being a Google employee is also not good 3nough
12/16/21, 19:02 - Ashwin: Owning tesla is not good enough since musk says he will retire and become an influencer
12/16/21, 19:03 - Ashwin: He just want you to give your all and achive better things. His way of saying might be slightly harsh
12/16/21, 19:03 - Tanushree: What he said is true only
12/16/21, 19:03 - Tanushree: But ya, harsh 😂
12/16/21, 19:03 - Ashwin: And believe me every father who wants best for his child is like thay
12/16/21, 19:04 - Ashwin: You need to believe in your potential. That's where the game is
12/16/21, 19:04 - Tanushree: I can't believe in myself when no one else does 😂
12/16/21, 19:04 - Tanushree: My worth is based on the validation I get from people I love
12/16/21, 19:04 - Ashwin: I believe you can make a breakthrough
12/16/21, 19:04 - Tanushree: Self awareness 🥲
12/16/21, 19:05 - Ashwin: It's just a matter of persistentnce
12/16/21, 19:05 - Ashwin: It's not. Deep down it's not.
12/16/21, 19:05 - Ashwin: At a very shallow level yes
12/16/21, 19:05 - Tanushree: Itna deep me gayi ni hu
12/16/21, 19:06 - Tanushree: But if my parents think I'm useless, then who gets to say I'm not
12/16/21, 19:06 - Tanushree: And if not useless then
12/16/21, 19:06 - Ashwin: Um you
12/16/21, 19:06 - Tanushree: Atleast not significant
12/16/21, 19:06 - Ashwin: Today I thought
12/16/21, 19:06 - Ashwin: As I was entering my office waiting for the lift
12/16/21, 19:06 - Ashwin: There is a lady who cleans the floor
12/16/21, 19:07 - Ashwin: She was cleaning and then talking to a big fat dog
12/16/21, 19:07 - Ashwin: There is big fat dog just outside our office
12/16/21, 19:07 - Ashwin: I don't know from where he get the food, (dogs in varuna mess are well fed understandable)
12/16/21, 19:07 - Ashwin: But she was talking to the dog like a child was was visibly happy
12/16/21, 19:08 - Ashwin: Now on significance who gets to decide whether her life is not significant to anyone?
12/16/21, 19:08 - Ashwin: She is doing whatever it is in her corner of the world
12/16/21, 19:08 - Tanushree: It's not an objective feeling na
12/16/21, 19:08 - Ashwin: It only with expectations far beyond your means you feel unhappy
12/16/21, 19:09 - Tanushree: I can try and try and change my course after fighting and not take up a job
12/16/21, 19:09 - Tanushree: But then, after all, I wanna make them satisfied too
12/16/21, 19:09 - Tanushree: It's not objectively decided
12/16/21, 19:09 - Ashwin: That is my point
12/16/21, 19:10 - Ashwin: If there is no objective definition of when "tanu gets to be a good daughter" why debase yourself through supposed expectation from your father
12/16/21, 19:10 - Ashwin: You are good daughter if you are independent and loving to your family
12/16/21, 19:10 - Ashwin: This is my subjective opinion
12/16/21, 19:10 - Ashwin: Similarly different people have different notion
12/16/21, 19:11 - Ashwin: Change yours not your fathers
12/16/21, 19:11 - Tanushree: Haan
12/16/21, 19:11 - Tanushree: My subjective opinion revolves around me being insignificant Bcoz I am of no use
12/16/21, 19:11 - Tanushree: But I'm trying to change, but rather it stays
12/16/21, 19:11 - Tanushree: That's why I don't wanna tell at home
12/16/21, 19:11 - Tanushree: Will just validate that I'm useles
12/16/21, 19:12 - Ashwin: It doesn't validate you are useless
12/16/21, 19:12 - Ashwin: It just identified a problem
12/16/21, 19:12 - Ashwin: And you know where the problem is
12/16/21, 19:12 - Ashwin: So don't blame your father
12/16/21, 19:12 - Tanushree: I didn't blame him
12/16/21, 19:12 - Tanushree: Did I?
12/16/21, 19:13 - Ashwin: Just make small efforts from your side to be good to people around you
12/16/21, 19:13 - Tanushree: I just said he isn't proud of me, and I have an intrinsic pressure to make
12/16/21, 19:13 - Tanushree: I don't care about other people
12/16/21, 19:13 - Ashwin: You made it seem like it was your fault that you haven't lived up to his expectations.
12/16/21, 19:14 - Ashwin: Inherently signaling that it is your father who made you feel this way
12/16/21, 19:14 - Tanushree: But I didn't blame him na
12/16/21, 19:14 - Ashwin: Yes
12/16/21, 19:14 - Ashwin: So good
12/16/21, 19:14 - Ashwin: So now we know problem is with you
12/16/21, 19:14 - Ashwin: Eliminate his expectations
12/16/21, 19:14 - Ashwin: There are many ways to make him proud
12/16/21, 19:15 - Ashwin: And you still got time
12/16/21, 19:15 - Ashwin: Whatever has happened has happened no point wallowing in past
12/16/21, 19:15 - Ashwin: I Mena you can take your time tj grieve it helps
12/16/21, 19:16 - Ashwin: But ultimate aim should be make best use of a bas situation
12/16/21, 19:16 - Ashwin: If you want to vent you have friend who will sympathise
12/16/21, 19:16 - Ashwin: But the solution to the problem lies with you
12/16/21, 19:16 - Ashwin: You have the potential to still save the day
12/16/21, 19:16 - Tanushree: It sounds like motivational speaker
12/16/21, 19:17 - Ashwin: It is
12/16/21, 19:17 - Ashwin: But sometimes it is what one has to hear
12/16/21, 19:17 - Ashwin: I feel pumped
12/16/21, 19:17 - Tanushree: 😂
12/16/21, 19:17 - Tanushree: I know these things
12/16/21, 19:17 - Ashwin: At the prospect of some opportunity
12/16/21, 19:17 - Tanushree: But I do fear na
12/16/21, 19:17 - Ashwin: To work on after debacle
12/16/21, 19:17 - Tanushree: And have emotions
12/16/21, 19:17 - Tanushree: These are flaws
12/16/21, 19:17 - Tanushree: But ultimately real
12/16/21, 19:17 - Ashwin: Yes
12/16/21, 19:18 - Ashwin: So don't cry over it
12/16/21, 19:18 - Ashwin: Accept them when they come
12/16/21, 19:18 - Ashwin: And move on
12/16/21, 19:18 - Tanushree: Emotions ka matlab hi toh hota h
12/16/21, 19:18 - Tanushree: Happy sad?
12/16/21, 19:18 - Tanushree: Sad lagega toh rou kese ni?
12/16/21, 19:18 - Ashwin: Ro lo
12/16/21, 19:18 - Ashwin: But can you be sad 24 7
12/16/21, 19:19 - Ashwin: One can

12/26/21, 08:52 - Ashwin: https://github.com/NeilGarrett?tab=repositories
12/26/21, 08:52 - Ashwin: These are all the projects
12/26/21, 08:52 - Ashwin: So it is not traditional reinforcement
12/26/21, 08:52 - Ashwin: He has applied it in behavioral tasks
12/26/21, 08:52 - Ashwin: Like 2 arm bandit problem

12/26/21, 08:54 - Ashwin: But banda looks hot
12/26/21, 09:07 - Ashwin: There is a lot to cover in this. Basically they are trying you reinforcement learning to predict emotions. Usual approach is to label it as angry sad etc but instead what they are betting on is a system of appraisels where the environment variables (like novelty, accountability) etc coupled with extrinsic reward will determine whether the agent is truly happy
12/26/21, 09:07 - Ashwin: A lot to explain in very para
12/26/21, 10:13 - Tanushree: Yaa that's how things are done.

12/29/21, 00:17 - Tanushree: She said she will call back
12/29/21, 00:17 - Tanushree: I guess no.
Ghar p hai shayad isliye
Who knows

Kabhi ni sunti me Spotify otherwise
12/29/21, 00:27 - Tanushree: Padhti
12/29/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: doesnt explain much
12/29/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: or i missed
12/29/21, 00:31 - Tanushree: What?
12/29/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: but give a github link to code
12/29/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: https://github.com/lei-zhang/socialRL
12/29/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: this paper
12/29/21, 00:31 - Ashwin: ill read what you have sent
12/29/21, 00:32 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/29/21, 00:32 - Tanushree: It's so weird na
12/29/21, 00:32 - Tanushree: You prefer seeing codes
12/29/21, 00:32 - Tanushree: And i desperately look for texts anywhere
12/29/21, 00:33 - Ashwin: i am also loking for explanations
12/29/21, 00:33 - Tanushree: You opened GitHub first
12/29/21, 00:34 - Ashwin: this doesnt not talk about reinforcement learningits is plainmachine learning
12/29/21, 00:34 - Ashwin: ijust saw the link
12/29/21, 00:35 - Tanushree: I know. It's still some sorta computation. I was going to read it Bcoz abstract se acha lagra kam
12/29/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: this is thebest resource
12/29/21, 00:47 - Ashwin: There are two main classes of algorithms for RL based on Equation 1; these classes focus on
either the left- or right-hand side of the equal sign in that equation. The first approach is based on
estimating the one-step reward and state transition distributions P(rt | st) and P(st+1 | st, at), which
together are known as an internal model of the MDP. Notably, these concern only immediate
events: which rewards or states directly follow other states and are thus easy to learn from local
experience, essentially by counting. Given these, it is possible to iteratively expand the right-hand
side of Equation 1 to compute the state-action value for any state and candidate action. Algorithms
for doing this, such as value iteration, essentially work by mental simulation, enumerating the
possible sequences of states that are expected to follow a starting state and action, summing
the rewards expected along these sequences, and using the learned model to keep track of their
probability (for a detailed presentation, see Daw & Dayan 2014).
This approach is known as model-based learning due to its reliance on the internal model. Its
main advantage is the simplicity of learning, but its main disadvantage is that this simplicity is
offset by computational complexity at choice time because producing state-action values depends
on extensive computation over many branching possible paths.
The second class of algorithms eschews learning a world model and instead learns a table
of long-run state-action values Q (the left-hand side of Equation 1) directly from experience.
The discovery of algorithms for accomplishing such model-free RL [in particular, the family of
temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithms; Sutton 1988] was a major advance in machine
learning that continues to provide the foundation for modern applications (e.g., Mnih et al. 2015).

12/29/21, 19:06 - Tanushree: 😂
12/29/21, 19:06 - Tanushree: Should I crack jokes or not?
12/29/21, 19:06 - Ashwin: You shouldn't at the outset
12/29/21, 19:06 - Ashwin: Maybe a little bit of flair
12/29/21, 19:06 - Tanushree: Other one is not computational. Behavioural toh experience 🤭
12/29/21, 19:07 - Tanushree: I'm not so classy

Wholesome
But i should study 😂
12/30/21, 05:48 - Tanushree: What is 
What is negative prediction error and positive prediction error and what it says about learning rate?
12/30/21, 08:00 - Ashwin: This is how you give positive reinforcement!
12/30/21, 08:02 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
12/30/21, 08:03 - Ashwin: You deleted this message
12/30/21, 08:04 - Ashwin: Learning rate itself is not producing any errors, errors are there because of the system modelling
12/30/21, 15:24 - Tanushree: https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/4/2769/files/2020/08/Trends-Cogn-Sci-2020-Biderman-1.pdf such a beautiful paper it is 😍 You may read too, shows RL in terms of human.
12/30/21, 15:24 - Tanushree: Expect too many hippocampal reference.
12/30/21, 15:53 - Ashwin: 😻
12/30/21, 16:45 - Tanushree: Imma wing it
12/30/21, 16:45 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
12/30/21, 16:46 - Tanushree: Aree saumya was asking about meeting today. I said no. In case she talks to you.
And it comes to me, i have told people that I'm interviewing for RA.
So dont mention anything about PhD interviews.
12/30/21, 16:51 - Ashwin: All the best
12/30/21, 16:51 - Ashwin: You look good
12/30/21, 18:28 - Ashwin: Yo
12/30/21, 18:28 - Ashwin: How was iy
12/30/21, 18:28 - Ashwin: It
12/30/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: It just ended
12/30/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: Idk
12/30/21, 18:31 - Tanushree: Overall it was nice
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: Butt
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: He asked me about my research interest
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: Andddds
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: I forgot
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/30/21, 18:32 - Ashwin: ?
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: Since I was reading so so many papers
12/30/21, 18:32 - Tanushree: I kinda forgot what i was interested in
12/30/21, 18:33 - Tanushree: He asked what sorta paradigm i maybe interested in, and honestly i hadn't thought about it
12/30/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: Okay
12/30/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: But you could
12/30/21, 18:33 - Ashwin: 'Wing' it
12/30/21, 18:34 - Tanushree: I forgot everything
12/30/21, 18:34 - Tanushree: He asked any recent paper you read?
12/30/21, 18:34 - Tanushree: I forgot that
12/30/21, 18:34 - Tanushree: I made him wait for 2-3 mins
12/30/21, 18:34 - Tanushree: And then narrated a paper i read last night 😂
12/30/21, 18:34 - Ashwin: So its recent only
12/30/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: I could've just said this but no
My dumb memory
12/30/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: That's okay
12/30/21, 18:35 - Ashwin: What were the nice parts
12/30/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: I asked him interesting questions
12/30/21, 18:35 - Tanushree: 😂😂
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: And
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: He is interested in what i wanna do too
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: Butt
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: He told everything beforehand in soooo much detail
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: I couldn't say anything original
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: I thought, shit sab toh bol diya isne
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: But he wanted me to elaborate on that
12/30/21, 18:36 - Tanushree: I just wanted to elaborate on what he said 🙂
12/30/21, 18:37 - Ashwin: Okay
12/30/21, 18:37 - Ashwin: What was his response
12/30/21, 18:37 - Tanushree: He was smiling
(On my dumbness)
12/30/21, 18:38 - Ashwin: Hmm okay
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: Then i guess i picked up
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: He asked which platforms i used for my experiment
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: How it went
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: Just want i did
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: And i picked up there
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: Buttttt
12/30/21, 18:38 - Ashwin: There's always a
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: I couldn't say much about what I am thinking of doing in future
12/30/21, 18:38 - Tanushree: 🥲🥲🥲
12/30/21, 18:39 - Ashwin: 🍑
12/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: And i laugh when i uncomfortable. This didn't help 🙂🙂🙂🙂
12/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: But whatever
12/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: Mock tha 😂
12/30/21, 18:39 - Ashwin: Yes. But take home the lesson learnt
12/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: He has asked for writing samplee
12/30/21, 18:39 - Tanushree: I'll send
12/30/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: His smiling was cute. Very distracting
12/30/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: 🤢
12/30/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: I don't know how it went exactly because I can't gage his response
12/30/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: But smiling is a good sign
12/30/21, 18:40 - Ashwin: What were?
12/30/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: He was waiting for me to pick up patiently
12/30/21, 18:40 - Tanushree: Stop being nervous?
12/30/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: No be soecific
12/30/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: Regarding for example
12/30/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: Usefulness of reading multiple papers
12/30/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Or useless of it
12/30/21, 18:41 - Ashwin: Topics you studied vs what subset actually came in handy
12/30/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: Maybe i should've focused more on what i wanna do
12/30/21, 18:41 - Tanushree: And less on what he is doing
12/30/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: I would disagree
12/30/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: If you want to make a good impression you cannot but not be interested in what he is doing
12/30/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: Once you have established that rapport
12/30/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: Then this comes in handy
12/30/21, 18:42 - Ashwin: So both things are important
12/30/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: He didn't ask what i read
12/30/21, 18:42 - Tanushree: Andddddd
12/30/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: I said something sooooooo
12/30/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: Stupid
12/30/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: He asked
If offered would you be interested in a funded phd here, or maybe you'd want to explore after that also?
12/30/21, 18:43 - Tanushree: And my dumb ass said
12/30/21, 18:44 - Tanushree: I'm not big on constantly exploring better options. If I get a position, i can also do my postdoc from a good place
12/30/21, 18:44 - Tanushree: I kinda implied the position isn't good enough 🥲🥲🥲🥲
12/30/21, 18:44 - Ashwin: I was expecting worse
12/30/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: With the number of os in this
12/30/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: Idk
12/30/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: I felt
12/30/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: I kinda implied that i said
12/30/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: Don't overthink
12/30/21, 18:45 - Tanushree: 'its okay if the position isn't good enough, I'll do better later'
12/30/21, 18:45 - Ashwin: This what I do when it comes to talking with women
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: 😢
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Yaa
12/30/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: That's what she said
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: I wish I had talked to more people online
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: I always avoided online chats with random men
12/30/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂😂
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Now I know the usefulness
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂😂
12/30/21, 18:46 - Ashwin: That's a unique takeaway
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: Haan
12/30/21, 18:46 - Tanushree: I forgot what i wanted to say

12/30/21, 18:48 - Tanushree: When will I be more confident
12/30/21, 18:49 - Ashwin: This is the process
12/30/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: Bad combo
12/30/21, 18:49 - Ashwin: You are more confident now
12/30/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: Smart men shouldn't have good face
12/30/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: It was hard to do both
12/30/21, 18:49 - Tanushree: Listen to him

12/30/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: Asap
12/30/21, 18:51 - Tanushree: What is that?
12/30/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: But also if possible
12/30/21, 18:51 - Ashwin: You are randomly matched with men
12/30/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: On video
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: 🥲
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: I still don't wanna do it
12/30/21, 18:52 - Ashwin: Do it?
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: And how are people so confident about talking to people online?
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: Let alone just talking
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: Or wait
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: It's easy for him.
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: He doesn't care if i judge him
12/30/21, 18:52 - Tanushree: 🙂
12/30/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: Good that you have psychoanalysed so much
12/30/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: But talking and getting nervous is not the point
12/30/21, 18:53 - Ashwin: Point is confidence
12/30/21, 18:54 - Ashwin: You derive confidence from either cockyness or good preparation
12/30/21, 18:54 - Ashwin: How to get cocky? Believe that bc you are the best in the business
12/30/21, 18:54 - Tanushree: I'll work on more prep
12/30/21, 18:54 - Ashwin: How to prepare? Think about  what he said and how interview went. And where you stumbled
12/30/21, 18:55 - Ashwin: Maybe write it down
12/30/21, 18:55 - Ashwin: We don't know how it went and the result
12/30/21, 18:55 - Tanushree: Yaq
12/30/21, 18:55 - Ashwin: But just prepare for the worst and expect the best
12/30/21, 18:56 - Ashwin: It ultimately boils down to experience or competance
12/30/21, 18:56 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>

1/1/22, 12:10 - Tanushree: Almost all men do or do not?
1/1/22, 12:11 - Ashwin: Almost all men do find the women attractive first
1/1/22, 12:11 - Tanushree: Which is okay
1/1/22, 12:11 - Tanushree: But he said, incapable of staying friends
1/1/22, 12:12 - Tanushree: So finding someone attractive and always finding someone attractive in similar sense is different
1/1/22, 12:12 - Ashwin: I get what he is trying to say but not what you are saying
1/1/22, 12:12 - Tanushree: Hawwww
1/1/22, 12:12 - Tanushree: So you suggesting my communication sucks?
1/1/22, 12:13 - Ashwin: He is saying that sleeping with women is just finding her attractive with multiple steps
1/1/22, 12:13 - Ashwin: And therefore she can't be friend friend
1/1/22, 12:13 - Ashwin: I didn't get this
1/1/22, 12:13 - Tanushree: Itna complex bola wo kuch?
1/1/22, 12:13 - Tanushree: Let me see again
1/1/22, 12:13 - Tanushree: And how is work?
Pehle din kaam kiya toh harr din karoge
1/1/22, 12:14 - Ashwin: It's chill
1/1/22, 12:14 - Ashwin: How did you start your new year
1/1/22, 12:14 - Tanushree: I was sleeping
1/1/22, 12:14 - Tanushree: I woke up
1/1/22, 12:15 - Tanushree: And i scrooled through reels
1/1/22, 12:15 - Tanushree: And keep doing it
1/1/22, 12:15 - Tanushree: And watched half a paper
1/1/22, 12:15 - Tanushree: Then more reels and a tv series episode
1/1/22, 12:15 - Tanushree: And ate junk and cake and slept
1/1/22, 12:16 - Tanushree: Nowwww
1/1/22, 12:16 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/1/22, 12:16 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/1/22, 12:16 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/1/22, 12:16 - Tanushree: He said exactly this.
1/1/22, 12:17 - Tanushree: Multiple steps kya hain? 😂
Simple chiz h
1/1/22, 13:36 - Ashwin: Yeah it's the logical conclusion
1/1/22, 13:37 - Ashwin: Good work enlarging the subtitles
1/1/22, 13:59 - Tanushree: I was wanted to know your opinion
1/1/22, 14:00 - Tanushree: Would to nice to hear from a male (that this guy is a weirdo)
1/1/22, 14:00 - Ashwin: He is a weirdo
1/1/22, 14:00 - Ashwin: But there is some method to the madness
1/1/22, 14:01 - Tanushree: Soooo
1/1/22, 14:01 - Tanushree: Not all men right?
1/1/22, 14:01 - Tanushree: Pata ni log national tv p itne controversial chize kese bolte
1/1/22, 14:01 - Tanushree: 😂
1/1/22, 14:02 - Ashwin: Not all men creates an air of satisfaction/closure that doesn't really address the issue infact it helps you make peace with the fact. Idk If it's an issue at all. I thought it was already intuition like elephant in the room.
1/1/22, 14:05 - Ashwin: He has to bombastic on national television because only when you are scandalous people notice. So there is exaggeration but maybe its coming from a place of truth. Truth being subjective to him and how he has viewed the world. If I was gay I would definitely have different opinion on the matter. So rather than missing the forest for the trees, an active listener can feel there is something being the opinion of the man. Similarly for others including Trump.
1/1/22, 14:10 - Tanushree: Wowowowwow
1/1/22, 14:10 - Tanushree: I dont understand it in first read
1/1/22, 14:10 - Tanushree: I'll do better

1/1/22, 14:20 - Ashwin: And you have an interview coming up
1/1/22, 14:20 - Ashwin: Better do something about that too
1/1/22, 15:10 - Tanushree: Thank lord for that
1/1/22, 15:10 - Tanushree: I'm reading papers
1/1/22, 15:10 - Tanushree: But that professor is not computational wala
1/1/22, 15:11 - Tanushree: So i feel i have good knowledge to not panic about it. I'll read and prepare something nicely
1/1/22, 15:11 - Tanushree: (not saying ho hi jayega, but I'm not anxious)

1/2/22, 21:24 - Ashwin: Both are up for casual hognogging
1/2/22, 21:24 - Tanushree: Hognogging is a word?
1/2/22, 21:24 - Tanushree: But he is cheating 😢
1/2/22, 21:25 - Ashwin: Everybody have their standards to live by
1/2/22, 21:25 - Ashwin: If he was a wild stallion would you fault him for looking for multiple mares
1/2/22, 21:25 - Ashwin: 😂
1/2/22, 21:26 - Tanushree: Standards and ethics alag. It's okay to feel comfortable when someone 'cheats'😢😢
1/2/22, 21:26 - Ashwin: This seems like it came from a 2005 movie
1/2/22, 21:26 - Ashwin: Comfortable
1/2/22, 21:26 - Tanushree: Uncomfortable
1/2/22, 21:26 - Tanushree: Thanks
1/2/22, 21:27 - Ashwin: It's okay to feel so. If you want me to validate your feelings
1/2/22, 21:27 - Tanushree: No it's okay
1/2/22, 21:28 - Ashwin: But nice to know that girls are so open to friends
1/2/22, 21:28 - Tanushree: Me want no validation. Mera bf thodi kara 😂
1/2/22, 21:28 - Ashwin: 😗
1/2/22, 21:28 - Tanushree: Yes. I know his dick no big 🤭
Batao, still cheating
1/2/22, 21:29 - Tanushree: But fine
1/2/22, 21:29 - Ashwin: Very specific with details I see
1/2/22, 21:29 - Tanushree: Me ku bitching kari
1/2/22, 21:29 - Ashwin: Pls do
1/2/22, 21:29 - Tanushree: I'm bas uncomfortable
1/2/22, 21:29 - Tanushree: With people doing it
1/2/22, 21:29 - Tanushree: Idk
1/2/22, 21:29 - Tanushree: 😂
1/2/22, 21:29 - Ashwin: I welcome some masala flavor maggi
1/2/22, 21:30 - Ashwin: I don't know what to feel
1/2/22, 21:30 - Ashwin: I am like the whole world is filled with so much wonder
1/2/22, 21:30 - Ashwin: 😂😂
1/2/22, 21:30 - Tanushree: I know
1/2/22, 21:30 - Tanushree: When i was young, in school
1/2/22, 21:30 - Tanushree: I thought cheating in relationship is so rare. And so unheard of
1/2/22, 21:31 - Tanushree: It won't happen to me.
1/2/22, 21:31 - Tanushree: So rare
1/2/22, 21:31 - Tanushree: And the first bf i had cheated 😂😂
1/2/22, 21:31 - Tanushree: So i kinda still feel uncomfortable when people do it
1/2/22, 21:31 - Tanushree: Jabki i know it's very common
1/2/22, 21:31 - Ashwin: It makes sense
1/2/22, 21:31 - Ashwin: Because you needed guts to be in relationships at that timr
1/2/22, 21:32 - Tanushree: It's not about guts also
1/2/22, 21:32 - Ashwin: And people with guts they do a lot of things
1/2/22, 21:32 - Tanushree: I was there, with my best self, and with everything I could give
1/2/22, 21:32 - Tanushree: And he didn't want that
1/2/22, 21:32 - Tanushree: 😂😂
1/2/22, 21:33 - Ashwin: But this makes me think about the question to which she replied the first message
1/2/22, 21:34 - Ashwin: You can give my brother the best chocolate in the world 70 percent cocoa and rest sweet caramelized sugar with nuts brownie and milk chocolate filling. He still won't like it
1/2/22, 21:34 - Ashwin: I am happy with 5rs dairy milk
1/2/22, 21:34 - Tanushree: Ya i know 😂
1/2/22, 21:34 - Ashwin: So its about preferences there is no absolute parameter for judging people or accepting people
1/2/22, 21:35 - Tanushree: But its hard being like that again, giving so much while not expecting much
1/2/22, 21:35 - Ashwin: It makes sense to be circumspect initially
1/2/22, 21:35 - Ashwin: Which is what you do now
1/2/22, 21:35 - Ashwin: But you nicely sidestepped this
1/2/22, 21:36 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
1/2/22, 21:36 - Tanushree: It was avai

1/2/22, 23:27 - Tanushree: Not taking the ride
1/2/22, 23:27 - Tanushree: But maybe i shouldn't be so rude
1/2/22, 23:28 - Ashwin: It's better to be safe than sorry right
1/2/22, 23:28 - Ashwin: It's better to he rude than take lift from a dude
1/2/22, 23:29 - Ashwin: Be
1/2/22, 23:29 - Tanushree: Not about taking the ride
1/2/22, 23:29 - Tanushree: But we were already acting like
1/2/22, 23:29 - Tanushree: They were bad people
1/2/22, 23:29 - Ashwin: It's better to walk than fall prey to silly talk
1/2/22, 23:29 - Tanushree: Ignoring, and talking rudely
1/2/22, 23:29 - Tanushree: That way
1/2/22, 23:30 - Ashwin: It's better to keep up your defense than face brunt of an offense
1/2/22, 23:30 - Tanushree: Han
1/2/22, 23:30 - Tanushree: Still
1/2/22, 23:30 - Tanushree: I feel bad
1/2/22, 23:30 - Tanushree: Being mean to nice people
1/2/22, 23:30 - Ashwin: You feel bad
1/2/22, 23:30 - Ashwin: Not because you made an old Amma wait
1/2/22, 23:31 - Ashwin: At a restaurant
1/2/22, 23:31 - Tanushree: If they were really trying to help, maybe they won't offer help to someone else who would need it
1/2/22, 23:31 - Tanushree: Bcoz some were rude
1/2/22, 23:31 - Ashwin: Bro you are getting too naive
1/2/22, 23:31 - Ashwin: Nobody offers lift to 3 girls in delhi
1/2/22, 23:31 - Tanushree: And many others. The old Amma came there to wait
1/2/22, 23:32 - Tanushree: People don't stay alone at night bcoz they want to
1/2/22, 23:32 - Tanushree: Who knows
1/2/22, 23:32 - Ashwin: You see a silver lining here
1/2/22, 23:32 - Ashwin: Find in rest of the situation you are in
1/2/22, 23:33 - Tanushree: Matlab
1/2/22, 23:35 - Ashwin: I just mean that it's amazing that you are sanguine enough to expect so much from humanity
1/2/22, 23:35 - Ashwin: Keep this positive vibes in everything you do
1/2/22, 23:35 - Tanushree: Jese?
1/2/22, 23:35 - Ashwin: In my opinion tho (for what it's worth) it was a close shave
1/2/22, 23:35 - Tanushree: It's not about me. I didn't need any help anyway. I booked my cab
1/2/22, 23:36 - Tanushree: I just mean, someone else might need it in future and they won't get bcoz i was rude
1/2/22, 23:36 - Ashwin: Expect best from the world.
1/2/22, 23:36 - Tanushree: I do
1/2/22, 23:36 - Tanushree: My anxiety doesn't
1/2/22, 23:36 - Tanushree: 😂
1/2/22, 23:36 - Ashwin: What I mean is your act only affect those people in the car
1/2/22, 23:36 - Ashwin: And those people were shady
1/2/22, 23:36 - Ashwin: I didn't see them
1/2/22, 23:37 - Tanushree: Haan
1/2/22, 23:37 - Tanushree: Directly
1/2/22, 23:37 - Tanushree: I don't really care about them 😂
1/2/22, 23:37 - Tanushree: Bas someone tomorrow maybe in great trouble
1/2/22, 23:37 - Tanushree: And i prevented the help probably
1/2/22, 23:37 - Ashwin: There is enough guilt life would offer you in future
1/2/22, 23:38 - Ashwin: You don't have to manufacture guilt trips
1/2/22, 23:38 - Tanushree: Like not eating 2 dosas and juice fast enough at a fast food place? 😂
1/2/22, 23:38 - Tanushree: I guess
1/2/22, 23:38 - Tanushree: I'll forget
1/2/22, 23:38 - Tanushree: But
1/2/22, 23:38 - Tanushree: Idk
1/2/22, 23:38 - Tanushree: I should try to be more polite
1/2/22, 23:39 - Ashwin: That was just one time man. And I didn't say anything till the waiter jabbed the receipt at my elbow 😂
1/2/22, 23:39 - Ashwin: You were polite enough!
1/2/22, 23:39 - Tanushree: One time before the many times 😂😂
1/2/22, 23:39 - Tanushree: Maybe.
1/2/22, 23:40 - Tanushree: Maybe i was just assertive and not rude.
1/2/22, 23:40 - Tanushree: Idk
1/2/22, 23:40 - Tanushree: Assertive is not my thing. Saying few things straight up also seem rude
1/2/22, 23:40 - Tanushree: But then, who knows
1/2/22, 23:40 - Ashwin: Bullshit
1/2/22, 23:40 - Ashwin: 😂
1/2/22, 23:41 - Ashwin: Now that's being assertive about what I think of you feeling guilty of being assertive
1/2/22, 23:41 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
1/2/22, 23:41 - Ashwin: There are many times?
1/2/22, 23:41 - Tanushree: Inception sentence
1/2/22, 23:41 - Tanushree: Matlab
1/2/22, 23:41 - Ashwin: I wonder
1/2/22, 23:42 - Ashwin: I mean prolly you'll be married soon
1/2/22, 23:42 - Tanushree: And?
1/2/22, 23:42 - Ashwin: Then ghar baar baccha

1/4/22, 03:55 - Tanushree: Anyway, or bhi datasets honge hi
1/4/22, 06:41 - Ashwin: You can use octave to open
1/4/22, 06:41 - Ashwin: Which is free
1/4/22, 06:41 - Tanushree: Haan
1/4/22, 06:42 - Tanushree: Have you used matlab?

1/4/22, 06:43 - Ashwin: To be true

1/4/22, 06:43 - Tanushree: It is tough? Boring?
1/4/22, 06:43 - Tanushree: Bcoz it's in demand if not anytime
1/4/22, 06:43 - Tanushree: Thing

1/4/22, 06:44 - Ashwin: So lot of people found it tough
1/4/22, 06:44 - Ashwin: It was my relaxant phase in college so I did well
1/4/22, 06:44 - Ashwin: But I don't remember much now

1/4/22, 18:44 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
1/4/22, 18:44 - Ashwin: This is missing from my game
1/4/22, 18:49 - Tanushree: 😐😐😐😐
1/4/22, 18:49 - Tanushree: Do this with someone. Record that.
1/4/22, 18:49 - Tanushree: Let's see how that goes
1/4/22, 18:51 - Ashwin: 😄😂😂😂
1/4/22, 18:51 - Ashwin: How was your day

1/4/22, 18:56 - Tanushree: Ikr?
1/4/22, 18:56 - Tanushree: Tough job
1/4/22, 18:56 - Tanushree: How was your day? Chilled at office?
1/4/22, 18:57 - Ashwin: I returned just now
1/4/22, 18:57 - Ashwin: Lot of work
1/4/22, 18:57 - Tanushree: Nah
1/4/22, 18:57 - Tanushree: 7 baje tak toh kya hi kam hoga
1/4/22, 18:57 - Ashwin: 😄😄
1/4/22, 18:57 - Ashwin: You should say this in your pitch to potential employers
1/4/22, 18:57 - Tanushree: Why? How would that help?
1/4/22, 18:58 - Ashwin: They'll know how sadist you are
1/4/22, 18:58 - Ashwin: And why 7 o clock would be just stand 3asy time for you
1/4/22, 18:58 - Tanushree: Seeing other people have a life while not having anything of my own is not called being sadist
1/4/22, 18:59 - Ashwin: You have so many friends
1/4/22, 18:59 - Tanushree: Ya, and all of them are sending me 2k monthly so i don't have to work
1/4/22, 18:59 - Tanushree: Sounds like a good life
1/4/22, 18:59 - Ashwin: 😂😂
1/4/22, 19:00 - Ashwin: What if they just send you 5 rs
1/4/22, 19:00 - Ashwin: How much will you earn
1/4/22, 19:00 - Tanushree: Idk
1/4/22, 19:00 - Tanushree: How much people value 5 rs?
1/4/22, 19:00 - Ashwin: 5k?
1/4/22, 19:00 - Ashwin: Atleast 1000 friends would be ready to part with 5 rs per month surely
1/4/22, 19:01 - Ashwin: Then comes the scaling part
1/4/22, 19:01 - Tanushree: I don't even know 1000 people
1/4/22, 19:01 - Ashwin: Oh you know
1/4/22, 19:01 - Ashwin: And the word flies
1/4/22, 19:01 - Ashwin: Then implement a tier system
1/4/22, 19:01 - Tanushree: That's not friends
1/4/22, 19:01 - Tanushree: That's chanda ikhata karna
1/4/22, 19:01 - Ashwin: Friends contributing more will have more privileges
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: This is exactly the subs model
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: So rs 10 from first 100
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: And rest 5
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: So you can see a bump of 1000 in that
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: While you do it
1/4/22, 19:02 - Tanushree: It won't work
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: People will see this experiment
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: And you'll be celebrity
1/4/22, 19:02 - Tanushree: 5k is not enough
1/4/22, 19:02 - Ashwin: So more followers
1/4/22, 19:02 - Tanushree: My month expense goes upto 10-12k
1/4/22, 19:03 - Ashwin: Tehro ruko zara
1/4/22, 19:03 - Ashwin: More followers would mean your name will spread like wildfire
1/4/22, 19:03 - Tanushree: What words will spread,m
1/4/22, 19:03 - Tanushree: A woman who has no skills is begging for money for not doing anything?
1/4/22, 19:04 - Ashwin: Yes
1/4/22, 19:04 - Ashwin: People
1/4/22, 19:04 - Ashwin: Die for this drama
1/4/22, 19:04 - Ashwin: You'll be an overnight celebrity'l

1/4/22, 19:04 - Ashwin: Sky is the limit
1/4/22, 19:04 - Ashwin: For example if I was pepsi
1/4/22, 19:05 - Ashwin: I'll come to you
1/4/22, 19:05 - Ashwin: To run ads for Pepsi featuring the most likeable girl on the planet
1/4/22, 19:05 - Ashwin: 😂
1/4/22, 19:06 - Tanushree: Likeable?
1/4/22, 19:06 - Tanushree: People begging are likeable?
1/4/22, 19:06 - Tanushree: Don't you think my onlyfan will work better this crap idea?
1/4/22, 19:06 - Ashwin: No its how you brand yourself
1/4/22, 19:06 - Ashwin: It's not begging if they are your friends
1/4/22, 19:06 - Tanushree: Pata ni
1/4/22, 19:07 - Tanushree: That's still begging
1/4/22, 19:07 - Ashwin: Only fan has a negative connotation while this is pure. Friendship is pure.
1/4/22, 19:07 - Tanushree: But begging friends feel less sad
1/4/22, 19:07 - Ashwin: That's the idea
1/4/22, 19:07 - Ashwin: Friends help
1/4/22, 19:07 - Ashwin: Yours would be the most viral cult ever
1/4/22, 19:07 - Tanushree: 😒

1/4/22, 19:08 - Tanushree: And I'll not be able to pay

1/5/22, 22:10 - Tanushree: What is the difference between package and framework
1/5/22, 22:12 - Ashwin: Which language
1/5/22, 22:13 - Ashwin: Package is usually a function which you can "install" externally to program. (Install means load it to memory whenever program is run)
1/5/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: Framework will enable you to write code by facilitating you in some manner. Like react is a framework in Javascript using which you can build website. Ultimately it is using js and html and css only however it has built many functions using this technology so you don't have to write then from scratch but use it using framework invocation
1/5/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: Call if I am not clear
1/5/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: It was a vague doubt
1/5/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: Kal I'll ask ache se

1/10/22, 07:01 - Ashwin: Of you having the right package
1/10/22, 07:01 - Tanushree: This just sounds wrong
1/10/22, 07:01 - Ashwin: The sample size will never be enough
1/10/22, 07:01 - Ashwin: So we have what we call faith

1/11/22, 21:35 - Tanushree: Including myself
1/11/22, 21:35 - Tanushree: My supervisor was mean

1/11/22, 21:40 - Tanushree: I wasn't always this straight forward or what?
1/11/22, 21:40 - Ashwin: Being easily pleased is a superpower in my book
1/11/22, 21:40 - Tanushree: I'm easily pleased too
1/11/22, 21:40 - Ashwin: No not commenting on your straight forwardness
1/11/22, 21:41 - Tanushree: They just to pretend to be smart and kind
1/11/22, 21:41 - Tanushree: And yaay

1/11/22, 21:42 - Ashwin: Who are the people whom you like
1/11/22, 21:42 - Tanushree: If i like someone, they gotta be smart and kind
1/11/22, 21:42 - Tanushree: If they are just one, I'll stick with them but not be too close

1/11/22, 21:43 - Ashwin: There is just one choice here
1/11/22, 21:43 - Tanushree: You are confusing me
1/11/22, 21:43 - Ashwin: Who pretended to be smart and kind
1/11/22, 21:44 - Ashwin: Who are the people whom you like...Who pretended to be smart and kind
1/11/22, 21:44 - Tanushree: Why is it sounding confrontational
1/11/22, 21:44 - Ashwin: I thought I was always this straightforward
1/11/22, 21:44 - Ashwin: 😂
1/11/22, 21:45 - Ashwin: With you atleast
1/11/22, 21:45 - Tanushree: I don't like many people too much
1/11/22, 21:45 - Tanushree: Sue me

1/11/22, 21:45 - Ashwin: Answer

1/11/22, 21:45 - Tanushree: That's the answer
1/11/22, 21:45 - Tanushree: 😂
1/11/22, 21:46 - Ashwin: Why would you say this then
1/11/22, 21:46 - Tanushree: I mean for initial interactions
1/11/22, 21:46 - Tanushree: People can pretend to be both
1/11/22, 21:46 - Tanushree: How long can someone always be smart and always be kind?
1/11/22, 21:46 - Tanushree: So Initially it's easy to like people
1/11/22, 21:47 - Ashwin: Okay
1/11/22, 21:47 - Ashwin: Can you give me examples
1/11/22, 21:47 - Ashwin: 2 marks for ex only
1/11/22, 21:47 - Tanushree: Vishaka 🐱
1/11/22, 21:47 - Ashwin: Her I know and...
1/11/22, 21:47 - Tanushree: Let me quickly see my contact list
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: Shivani
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: The cute girl who is in Germany
1/11/22, 21:48 - Ashwin: (Oh I didn't find neither of em cute but fine)
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: And i like you so I'll say it
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: Doshi too
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: 😂
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: He is either smart or kind
1/11/22, 21:48 - Tanushree: But he is not both
1/11/22, 21:49 - Ashwin: 😂😂
1/11/22, 21:49 - Tanushree: And i don't understand which one he is not
1/11/22, 21:49 - Ashwin: Is it so hard to make out?
1/11/22, 21:49 - Tanushree: Keep your standards like this and you'll die a virgin
1/11/22, 21:49 - Tanushree: I don't want to judge so directly if i know them for so long na
1/11/22, 21:49 - Ashwin: I'll make my maamaa proud
1/11/22, 21:49 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
1/11/22, 21:50 - Ashwin: 🙂
1/11/22, 21:50 - Ashwin: I mean
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: I mean it's not so hard
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: To know
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: Most of the time
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: Shankari is superr kind
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: And okayish smart.
1/11/22, 21:50 - Ashwin: It's easy to make out head or heart. But not being confused between the two
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: It's easy to know
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: But with some people
1/11/22, 21:50 - Tanushree: It's hard to know
1/11/22, 21:51 - Tanushree: If they are smart, that's why they are being kind
1/11/22, 21:51 - Tanushree: Or they are kind, which is making up for their smartness
1/11/22, 21:51 - Tanushree: Mostly it's easy to know
1/11/22, 21:51 - Tanushree: But not always
1/11/22, 21:51 - Ashwin: Woah thats some next level causal analysis there
1/11/22, 21:52 - Ashwin: But you should judge people by their action and not through their motivation
1/11/22, 21:52 - Tanushree: People's action with different people will vary
1/11/22, 21:52 - Ashwin: (I know I know different school s of philosophy)
1/11/22, 21:52 - Tanushree: Idc how they are with other people
1/11/22, 21:53 - Tanushree: If they are super nice with others and not me, good for them but I'm not going forward
1/11/22, 21:53 - Tanushree: If they are bitches with other but not me, I'll try to understand their reasons
1/11/22, 21:53 - Ashwin: Hmm this is the time when one should look internally
1/11/22, 21:53 - Ashwin: And this is the time to be wary
1/11/22, 21:53 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
1/11/22, 21:53 - Ashwin: But okay
1/11/22, 21:54 - Tanushree: Yes, but in the meantime, they are not for you
1/11/22, 21:54 - Ashwin: You are a shining example who is surviving
1/11/22, 21:54 - Tanushree: Plus nice people can't be nice with everyone na 😂
1/11/22, 21:54 - Ashwin: So its working for you
1/11/22, 21:54 - Tanushree: How much can a casual friend hurt anyway? 😂😂
1/11/22, 21:54 - Ashwin: Of they aren't then it's not their nature they have an ulterior motive. Does that make sense?
1/11/22, 21:55 - Ashwin: It depends how far you are willing to go
1/11/22, 21:55 - Ashwin: With that casual friends
1/11/22, 21:55 - Ashwin: In your interaction
1/11/22, 21:55 - Tanushree: Will see the motive as the time comes
1/11/22, 21:55 - Tanushree: Idk
1/11/22, 21:55 - Tanushree: Do you think I'm too trusting?
1/11/22, 21:55 - Ashwin: Okay. But some foresight helps
1/11/22, 21:55 - Tanushree: Personal level p what you think?
1/11/22, 21:55 - Ashwin: You are
1/11/22, 21:55 - Tanushree: That's what my assistant aman will do
1/11/22, 21:56 - Tanushree: 😂😂
1/11/22, 21:56 - Tanushree: It seems to me too.
1/11/22, 21:56 - Ashwin: 🙂👍👍
1/11/22, 21:56 - Ashwin: Yeah
1/11/22, 21:56 - Tanushree: Idk what to do about it
1/11/22, 21:57 - Tanushree: Anyway
1/11/22, 21:57 - Tanushree: I told you this
1/11/22, 21:57 - Tanushree: I didn't
1/11/22, 21:57 - Tanushree: I'm writing a proposal for the other university
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: Portsmouth
1/11/22, 21:58 - Ashwin: Ahh nice
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: But I'm not sure how much I'm excited about this
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: The professor liked me
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: I didn't like him too much
1/11/22, 21:58 - Ashwin: 😀😂
1/11/22, 21:58 - Ashwin: Don't play games here
1/11/22, 21:58 - Ashwin: People like you
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: Which games?
1/11/22, 21:58 - Ashwin: You don't like em
1/11/22, 21:58 - Ashwin: They don't like you
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: 😂😂
1/11/22, 21:58 - Tanushree: What?
1/11/22, 21:59 - Ashwin: You are behind them
1/11/22, 21:59 - Ashwin: It's classic nibba nibbi
1/11/22, 21:59 - Ashwin: Syndrome
1/11/22, 21:59 - Tanushree: Shouldn't the nibba always be the same?
1/11/22, 21:59 - Ashwin: Polyamourous nibba nibbi
1/11/22, 21:59 - Ashwin: Anyway
1/11/22, 22:00 - Ashwin: Continue
1/11/22, 22:00 - Tanushree: And yet I'll get a uti if i sleep with anyone new 🤢
1/11/22, 22:00 - Ashwin: Woah 0 to 10000
1/11/22, 22:00 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂😂
1/11/22, 22:00 - Ashwin: Have you been sleeping around lately?
1/11/22, 22:00 - Tanushree: So I'm writing the proposal but i also wanna crib bcoz idk what am I doing
1/11/22, 22:00 - Tanushree: No
1/11/22, 22:00 - Tanushree: Lately?
1/11/22, 22:01 - Tanushree: You know what i am doing for last 1 year now
1/11/22, 22:01 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
1/11/22, 22:01 - Ashwin: Women always have their cards pressed close to their bosoms
1/11/22, 22:01 - Ashwin: Okay if you need some help
1/11/22, 22:01 - Ashwin: I am free
1/11/22, 22:01 - Tanushree: I'm not too good with lies
1/11/22, 22:02 - Tanushree: I need help
1/11/22, 22:02 - Tanushree: Deciding
1/11/22, 22:02 - Tanushree: If I'm good enough or not
1/11/22, 22:02 - Ashwin: For
1/11/22, 22:02 - Tanushree: For the university
1/11/22, 22:02 - Ashwin: Yes
1/11/22, 22:02 - Tanushree: So should I go forward with this or not?
1/11/22, 22:03 - Ashwin: Yes. What are the cons
1/11/22, 22:03 - Tanushree: Try to keep an open mind
1/11/22, 22:03 - Tanushree: Don't judge me
1/11/22, 22:03 - Tanushree: Bcoz i have too consider alot of things with future context
1/11/22, 22:06 - Tanushree: Cons
1. The ranking is approx 500. It's usually moves upwards with each next college.
2. The professor is super new (like neil) but he has no collabs (like neil had with UCL, havards). So I'm worried I'll have to pave my own way.
3. The course name is Phd forensic psychology. So it automatically makes my path a little constricted.
4. They want me to do a masters (funded) which will make it 4 years.
5. They don't have Fmri. I'm okau with eeg too, but why would a good place not have an Fmri?
1/11/22, 22:07 - Ashwin: Ok
1/11/22, 22:09 - Tanushree: Pros
1. I like the course. I like the topic in general. It's of my interest. But alot of things are of my interest. Should I apply for better.
2. The professor seems awkward. He seemed alot like me. Fumbling, nervous. But he was welcoming. He was nice and trying to say and do the right things.
3. The place is 1 hr away from London. And all the good labs are in London, NY, Switzerland, California.
4. Its is completely funded. The masters, phd etc. I'll get good stipend.
1/11/22, 22:10 - Ashwin: Okay
1/11/22, 22:10 - Ashwin: Did you check how mature is the program
1/11/22, 22:11 - Tanushree: Psychology department is there for a while
1/11/22, 22:11 - Tanushree: But forensic is new
1/11/22, 22:11 - Tanushree: 10 years or so
1/11/22, 22:12 - Ashwin: Okay. Then from that standpoint its an up and coming lab program may not have matured much. But this also gives you greater flexibility and authority over the lab you go to. Since you will be part of the transformation. The lack of fmri might just be because of that
1/11/22, 22:13 - Ashwin: PhD in forensic psychology seems fancy and since you do watch a lot of true crime videos
1/11/22, 22:13 - Ashwin: It feels really a good constraint. Sometimes we need contriants to give our best .to channelize
1/11/22, 22:14 - Tanushree: But isn't it amazing having all the options? Like i can apply anywhere including industry right now
1/11/22, 22:14 - Tanushree: It's uncomfortable losing this freedom to apply anywhere later
1/11/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: You are talking with a person who is looking at a naval career for next decade
1/11/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: Don't discuss options with me
1/11/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: You eventually have to choose
1/11/22, 22:15 - Tanushree: Atleast you have money
1/11/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: You'll have more
1/11/22, 22:15 - Tanushree: Tomorrow, i don't wanna struggle with money
1/11/22, 22:15 - Tanushree: That's all
1/11/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: But that's not the thing here
1/11/22, 22:15 - Ashwin: You are getting something which is of your jnterest in your dept
1/11/22, 22:16 - Ashwin: I feel you should really go for it
1/11/22, 22:16 - Ashwin: Maybe try two or three more places
1/11/22, 22:16 - Ashwin: But keep it in backburner
1/11/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: Yaa
1/11/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: That's the thing
1/11/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: So this professor
1/11/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: Is new
1/11/22, 22:16 - Ashwin: Which is a blessing and a curse
1/11/22, 22:16 - Tanushree: And they have to sponser a kid who will take the opportunity
1/11/22, 22:17 - Tanushree: If they don't take it, he will be left with no student
1/11/22, 22:17 - Tanushree: They can only sponser one at a time
1/11/22, 22:17 - Tanushree: He said he can sponser me
1/11/22, 22:17 - Ashwin: Okay don't make em sound all sobby
1/11/22, 22:17 - Tanushree: But that will put him in a hot soup later
1/11/22, 22:17 - Tanushree: What is that
1/11/22, 22:18 - Ashwin: Like they ready have someone?
1/11/22, 22:18 - Ashwin: Already
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: He said he has interviewed some
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: Just like neil 😂
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: Like he interviewed some kids
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: And he had to take one
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: So if he wanted me, wo puch leta
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: But he didn't
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: Same here
1/11/22, 22:18 - Tanushree: He has some
1/11/22, 22:19 - Tanushree: Out of them
1/11/22, 22:19 - Tanushree: He said he can sponser me
1/11/22, 22:19 - Ashwin: ?
1/11/22, 22:19 - Tanushree: What?
1/11/22, 22:19 - Ashwin: Yeah he said this right
1/11/22, 22:19 - Ashwin: Then?
1/11/22, 22:19 - Tanushree: But i should also confirm
1/11/22, 22:19 - Tanushree: If I'll take it
1/11/22, 22:19 - Tanushree: Else he won't have any students
1/11/22, 22:20 - Tanushree: Obviously I can leave him later
1/11/22, 22:20 - Tanushree: 😂
1/11/22, 22:20 - Tanushree: It's just on trust and my words
1/11/22, 22:20 - Tanushree: No bond
1/11/22, 22:20 - Ashwin: Haan which he expected you to do
1/11/22, 22:20 - Ashwin: So here's the thing.
1/11/22, 22:20 - Ashwin: If you want my imho
1/11/22, 22:21 - Tanushree: Imho?
1/11/22, 22:21 - Ashwin: Just check the background of the program and the prof and the scheme
1/11/22, 22:21 - Ashwin: Make sure it's legit
1/11/22, 22:21 - Ashwin: And go for it
1/11/22, 22:21 - Tanushree: It is legit
1/11/22, 22:21 - Tanushree: 😂
1/11/22, 22:21 - Tanushree: I have checked
1/11/22, 22:22 - Tanushree: The Psychology department came up in 1960s or something
1/11/22, 22:22 - Tanushree: Forensic came later
1/11/22, 22:22 - Tanushree: This professor is originally from Brazil. But he did his PhD from here and he has to be the most lucky immigrant, bcoz he got tenure here only
1/11/22, 22:23 - Tanushree: Hence he didn't apply to other top places so no collab
1/11/22, 22:23 - Tanushree: And scheme? 🙂
1/11/22, 22:23 - Ashwin: Okay

1/13/22, 08:31 - Ashwin: Ep 8
1/13/22, 08:31 - Ashwin: It's a good one
1/13/22, 08:31 - Ashwin: Things are looking up for the show
1/13/22, 08:32 - Tanushree: Keep watching. Let me know if it's fun.
1/13/22, 08:33 - Ashwin: Hmmm
1/13/22, 09:03 - Ashwin: It's worth watching atleast for sake of conversation
1/13/22, 09:03 - Ashwin: But it gets better
1/13/22, 09:03 - Ashwin: Now more of a mordern family vibe
1/13/22, 09:03 - Ashwin: But too many ep in a season
1/13/22, 09:09 - Tanushree: It has 80 episodes, which is approx 30 hrs of my life.
I generally waste my time, atleast i should like wasting it 😂😂
1/13/22, 09:10 - Tanushree: Is it funny? (Like friends, or Brooklyn 9 9)
1/13/22, 09:10 - Ashwin: I've watched 10 ep
1/13/22, 09:10 - Tanushree: Didn't look like thriller or any serious drama to me
1/13/22, 09:10 - Ashwin: It's situational funny
1/13/22, 09:10 - Ashwin: Not through gag jokes
1/13/22, 09:11 - Ashwin: It's not. It's one of those shows where you relax and play
1/13/22, 09:11 - Tanushree: First 2 episodes were really bad 😂
1/13/22, 09:11 - Tanushree: But since you are saying, I'll give it a try
1/13/22, 09:11 - Tanushree: Trust you 🥸
1/13/22, 09:11 - Ashwin: I mean

1/13/22, 09:12 - Ashwin: But its not stimulating
1/13/22, 09:12 - Tanushree: Friends is not stimulating, but atleast it's funny 😂
1/13/22, 09:13 - Ashwin: It is more like the office and mordern family in a way
1/13/22, 09:13 - Ashwin: Friends was old school
1/13/22, 09:13 - Tanushree: These people had a really really bad caricaturish depiction of rich and mean people
1/13/22, 09:13 - Ashwin: These days comedy is about imitating life in funny situations
1/13/22, 09:13 - Tanushree: I didn't like office season 1 🥲
1/13/22, 09:13 - Tanushree: Modern family i haven't seen
1/13/22, 09:13 - Ashwin: Okay yeah so there you'll be surprised that there's more to them
1/13/22, 09:14 - Ashwin: Ohh
1/13/22, 09:14 - Ashwin: Well if you like mockumentary types I would suggest start with office first
1/13/22, 09:14 - Tanushree: I wasn't expecting them to stay the same for 6 seasons 😂😂
1/13/22, 09:14 - Tanushree: It was annoying
1/13/22, 09:14 - Ashwin: They'll be the same I think
1/13/22, 09:14 - Tanushree: I have a bad taste in comedy i guess
1/13/22, 09:14 - Ashwin: But they have something extra
1/13/22, 09:15 - Tanushree: Sometimes they like to help each other instead of constantly bickering over nothing 😍😍😍 yaaas
1/13/22, 09:15 - Ashwin: 😂😂
1/13/22, 09:15 - Ashwin: You want another podcast?

1/13/22, 09:46 - Ashwin: 5 years before you were a free spirit roaming in search of war veteran loooking for a tinder date
1/13/22, 09:46 - Tanushree: 2 years*
1/13/22, 09:46 - Ashwin: now you are all sedate looking to settle down
1/13/22, 09:46 - Ashwin: people change
1/13/22, 09:46 - Tanushree: I know
1/13/22, 09:46 - Ashwin: and you gotta accept it
1/13/22, 09:46 - Tanushree: And nothing against that
1/13/22, 09:46 - Tanushree: But then
1/13/22, 09:46 - Tanushree: People judge?
1/13/22, 09:47 - Tanushree: And I don't have problem with anyone changing
1/13/22, 09:47 - Tanushree: It's judge
1/13/22, 09:47 - Ashwin: they judge you?
1/13/22, 09:48 - Tanushree: We used to have certain opinion about certain things and one used to have rather strong opinions
1/13/22, 09:48 - Tanushree: And now that's the opposite. And i can't just forget how those opinions were before
1/13/22, 09:48 - Tanushree: I guess not.
1/13/22, 09:49 - Ashwin: okay
1/13/22, 09:49 - Ashwin: but change means change in opnion too
1/13/22, 09:49 - Tanushree: But then I'm not going around telling everyone i judge. So i can't say na.
1/13/22, 09:49 - Tanushree: If both of us dislike muslims. But you hate muslims, much more than me.
1/13/22, 09:50 - Tanushree: Tomorrow, you start hanging out with muslims and enjoy going to mosque
1/13/22, 09:50 - Tanushree: While i still dislike muslims
1/13/22, 09:50 - Tanushree: I'll have a difficult time no?
1/13/22, 09:50 - Tanushree: I'll find it hypocritical.
1/13/22, 09:51 - Ashwin: okay I got your point
1/13/22, 09:51 - Tanushree: I'm happy for them, but then when people change, they tend to go in different directions
1/13/22, 09:52 - Tanushree: I'll also take time accepting certain things i didn't really sign up for
1/13/22, 09:52 - Ashwin: okay
1/13/22, 09:52 - Ashwin: but you didnt sign up for
1/13/22, 09:52 - Ashwin: then its okay right
1/13/22, 09:52 - Tanushree: It's okay
1/13/22, 09:52 - Tanushree: I know
1/13/22, 09:52 - Tanushree: And
1/13/22, 09:53 - Ashwin: but you may feel left out
1/13/22, 09:53 - Tanushree: You won't tell me anything i don't already know
1/13/22, 09:53 - Tanushree: But then I'm seeing people change, they maybe seeing me change
1/13/22, 09:53 - Tanushree: So it's a hard change
1/13/22, 09:53 - Ashwin: .
1/13/22, 09:53 - Ashwin: ?
1/13/22, 09:54 - Ashwin: It is a hard change
1/13/22, 09:54 - Tanushree: You do this sometimes. Try to justify from the other side
1/13/22, 09:54 - Tanushree: Sometimes i don't want that
1/13/22, 09:54 - Tanushree: Sometimes i just share
1/13/22, 09:54 - Tanushree: 🐱
1/13/22, 09:54 - Ashwin: Okay 👍
1/13/22, 09:54 - Ashwin: I try to be the other party word of reason
1/13/22, 09:55 - Ashwin: So that you can have a mock battle
1/13/22, 09:55 - Ashwin: 😂
1/13/22, 09:55 - Tanushree: It's not always about knowing what right
1/13/22, 09:55 - Tanushree: I know what it is
1/13/22, 09:55 - Tanushree: This i know
1/13/22, 09:55 - Tanushree: And i know I shouldn't judge older friends
1/13/22, 09:56 - Tanushree: But then, it's not a debate if i should or shouldn't
1/13/22, 09:56 - Tanushree: It's just a fact that i do
1/13/22, 09:56 - Ashwin: Okay
1/13/22, 09:57 - Ashwin: What a selfless thing to say - I would've said if you hadn't given me the warning
1/13/22, 09:57 - Tanushree: Matlab? 😂
1/13/22, 09:57 - Ashwin: I wrote it purposefully to confuse 😂
1/13/22, 09:57 - Tanushree: 😂😂
1/13/22, 09:57 - Ashwin: But I do wonder
1/13/22, 09:58 - Ashwin: Like let's not even talk about them
1/13/22, 09:58 - Ashwin: Them you know for 5 years
1/13/22, 09:58 - Ashwin: But even us talking like this
1/13/22, 09:58 - Ashwin: This would change right
1/13/22, 09:59 - Ashwin: I say that I won't like a high strung women and then I literally do marry a high strung women in an expensive arranged marriage
1/13/22, 09:59 - Ashwin: You would feel that I have double standards right
1/13/22, 09:59 - Ashwin: And yes
1/13/22, 09:59 - Ashwin: You would be right
1/13/22, 09:59 - Ashwin: I didn't accept it before because I was always such a  schooled geek
1/13/22, 10:00 - Ashwin: But people change very quickly I used to dislike it at first
1/13/22, 10:00 - Ashwin: Because that change is often demonized in our own way because we don't like our friends to go
1/13/22, 10:00 - Ashwin: Or our parents to change
1/13/22, 10:01 - Ashwin: But slowly I have come to accept that that's the way life is
1/13/22, 10:01 - Ashwin: My father was a figure of authority before
1/13/22, 10:01 - Ashwin: He is so lovable and cute now
1/13/22, 10:01 - Ashwin: What changed ? Maybe not them maybe you? Maybe time
1/13/22, 10:02 - Ashwin: That's why I want to become more forgiving about people's past
1/13/22, 10:02 - Ashwin: You can rake it up in a friendly banter
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: It's not about me not being friendly
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: Sorry
1/13/22, 10:03 - Ashwin: No I am not pointing to you
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: Forgiving
1/13/22, 10:03 - Ashwin: I am just saying people change that's a fact
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: I think
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: What i am saying is
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: And shayad
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: It's not very clear
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: But
1/13/22, 10:03 - Tanushree: I'm finding my friends annoying
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: Now how is it sounding?
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: Change is fine
1/13/22, 10:04 - Ashwin: This I got
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: But
1/13/22, 10:04 - Ashwin: Thr reason was because they have double standards ?
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: Either i can let them go or try to understand them
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: No
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: Initially things were relatable
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: Now that they have changed
1/13/22, 10:04 - Tanushree: It's not
1/13/22, 10:05 - Tanushree: Different opinions
1/13/22, 10:05 - Tanushree: And it's hard to talk after a while
1/13/22, 10:05 - Ashwin: Okay
1/13/22, 10:05 - Ashwin: Do you want to talk?
1/13/22, 10:06 - Ashwin: If you do then you gotta adapt
1/13/22, 10:06 - Tanushree: It will either end up being
1) me saying things to strongly and them thinking I take things too seriously
2) or me not talking and wanting to do something else
1/13/22, 10:06 - Tanushree: Adapt is just a word
1/13/22, 10:06 - Tanushree: How is the question
1/13/22, 10:06 - Tanushree: How does one adapt?
1/13/22, 10:06 - Ashwin: It's quite simple
1/13/22, 10:06 - Ashwin: Let go of the whole me thing
1/13/22, 10:07 - Ashwin: And join in a discussion
1/13/22, 10:07 - Ashwin: On what they say
1/13/22, 10:07 - Ashwin: You'll need to let go of your previous notion of them at the door
1/13/22, 10:07 - Tanushree: It's not previous notion of anyone else
1/13/22, 10:07 - Tanushree: It's me
1/13/22, 10:07 - Ashwin: Go with a fresh mind and strength of shared experiences
1/13/22, 10:08 - Tanushree: With you
1/13/22, 10:08 - Tanushree: I can say you are being annoying
1/13/22, 10:08 - Ashwin: Me needs to be flexible
1/13/22, 10:08 - Tanushree: And you might understand
1/13/22, 10:08 - Tanushree: That's me
1/13/22, 10:08 - Tanushree: I'll say things which might hurt but I don't mean it so harshly
1/13/22, 10:09 - Tanushree: You think i can so easily say things in front of others and they themselves won't stop talking?
1/13/22, 10:09 - Tanushree: You don't think saumya is sensitive?
1/13/22, 10:09 - Tanushree: And me being flexible won't hurt her?
1/13/22, 10:09 - Tanushree: I'm being straightforward now?
1/13/22, 10:10 - Ashwin: You being flexible about accommodating her opinion would hurt her ?
1/13/22, 10:10 - Ashwin: Who's the adversary here
1/13/22, 10:10 - Tanushree: No one is
1/13/22, 10:10 - Tanushree: Sometimes it's easier not saying things
1/13/22, 10:10 - Tanushree: Other things it's not
1/13/22, 10:10 - Ashwin: Okay
1/13/22, 10:11 - Ashwin: How will it hurt her
1/13/22, 10:11 - Tanushree: I can be flexible and join a conversation and say things like i say
1/13/22, 10:11 - Tanushree: You remember how long it hurt her when i casually said boring?
1/13/22, 10:11 - Tanushree: I didn't even mean it like that
1/13/22, 10:11 - Tanushree: It's just a loving way. And i explained her after she told me about it a month later
1/13/22, 10:11 - Tanushree: Elaborately
1/13/22, 10:11 - Tanushree: And it didn't help much. She takes her time
1/13/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: Okay
1/13/22, 10:12 - Tanushree: I can't just bluntly join a conversation and not think about the other person
1/13/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: Yes that's what you gotta do
1/13/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: And you can do it for some time
1/13/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: Waiting for people to warm up to you
1/13/22, 10:13 - Ashwin: And that's it slowly they'll come around if you are logical enough
1/13/22, 10:13 - Ashwin: People listen to logic only after they realise you are a good chap
1/13/22, 10:13 - Ashwin: 😂
1/13/22, 10:13 - Tanushree: It's not about me being logical. It's about me saying things in a better say
1/13/22, 10:14 - Tanushree: Around her
1/13/22, 10:14 - Ashwin: Okay
1/13/22, 10:14 - Tanushree: I feel i should say things in a certain way
1/13/22, 10:14 - Tanushree: Her opinions are usually strong
1/13/22, 10:14 - Tanushree: And I'm being judgemental, but is she not?
1/13/22, 10:15 - Tanushree: She is not open to many ideas either. So it's hard for me to say things
1/13/22, 10:16 - Tanushree: I'm not good at verbally explaining anything
1/13/22, 10:16 - Tanushree: So dont 😂
1/13/22, 10:16 - Ashwin: No but you just trying to explain will help sort the matter out in your head a bit
1/13/22, 10:17 - Tanushree: I explained
1/13/22, 10:17 - Ashwin: Also on text I feel like I am not getting you entirely
1/13/22, 10:17 - Ashwin: Here is my summary
1/13/22, 10:17 - Ashwin: Flawed edition
1/13/22, 10:17 - Ashwin: You want it
1/13/22, 10:17 - Tanushree: I usually say the wrong things on calls (or anytime i speak)
1/13/22, 10:17 - Ashwin: Welcome to the club me too
1/13/22, 10:18 - Tanushree: Atleast I'm better at texts 🐱
1/13/22, 10:18 - Ashwin: Closeted introverts tend to be
1/13/22, 10:18 - Tanushree: Don't lose track kid😂
1/13/22, 10:18 - Tanushree: Bolo
1/13/22, 10:18 - Ashwin: Then let's talk
1/13/22, 10:19 - Tanushree: Idk if i can afford talk therapy
1/13/22, 10:19 - Tanushree: 😢
1/13/22, 10:19 - Ashwin: 😂
1/13/22, 10:19 - Ashwin: Of nothing else I'll hear you cry
1/13/22, 10:19 - Ashwin: That will be my fees
1/13/22, 10:19 - Tanushree: I knew you are counting on it
1/13/22, 10:19 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
1/13/22, 10:19 - Ashwin: 😂😂😂
1/13/22, 10:20 - Tanushree: I'll talk
1/13/22, 10:20 - Tanushree: After 1 am
1/13/22, 10:20 - Tanushree: Or when we meet
1/13/22, 10:20 - Tanushree: 😂
1/13/22, 10:20 - Ashwin: 😂😂
1/13/22, 10:20 - Tanushree: Call is not happening
1/13/22, 10:20 - Ashwin: Okay ☺
1/13/22, 10:20 - Tanushree: 🥸
1/13/22, 10:20 - Ashwin: So you are worried about:
1/13/22, 10:21 - Ashwin: 1. your friend has changed her opinions
1/13/22, 10:21 - Tanushree: I have discussed it before also
1/13/22, 10:21 - Tanushree: Nooo
1/13/22, 10:21 - Tanushree: I'm not worried about this
1/13/22, 10:21 - Ashwin: 2. now when you talk to her she has new opinion
1/13/22, 10:21 - Ashwin: 3. which she feels strongly about
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: 😂
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: No
1/13/22, 10:22 - Ashwin: 4. so the the shared old opinion which you have with her is now not taken seriously
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: Nooo
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: Okay
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: Let me do it
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: In a small
1/13/22, 10:22 - Ashwin: 5. you feel betrayed
1/13/22, 10:22 - Tanushree: Text
1/13/22, 10:22 - Ashwin: okay
1/13/22, 10:23 - Tanushree: Initially also, she had strong and closed opinions. But atleast they were similar so it was easier talking about them.
1/13/22, 10:24 - Tanushree: Now they are different but again the person is the same just the opinions changed. And i find it hard to talk freely now
1/13/22, 10:25 - Ashwin: okay. in talking freely , you cant resist saying to her that you have changed
1/13/22, 10:25 - Tanushree: I have three options
Try to have similar opinions so i don't get left out and actually talk
Not talk
Find new friends
1/13/22, 10:25 - Ashwin: but you can say it because she is sensitive
1/13/22, 10:25 - Tanushree: No.
1/13/22, 10:25 - Ashwin: what no
1/13/22, 10:25 - Tanushree: If you do something stupid, i will tell you you are being stupid
1/13/22, 10:25 - Ashwin: atleast agree once
1/13/22, 10:26 - Tanushree: It's not that she changed
1/13/22, 10:26 - Tanushree: Change is fine
1/13/22, 10:26 - Tanushree: But i wanna say it's stupid when asked for my opinion
1/13/22, 10:27 - Ashwin: i would say there is a 4th way
1/13/22, 10:27 - Ashwin: you can say it stupid in an agreeable way
1/13/22, 10:27 - Ashwin: by being genuine and sensitive
1/13/22, 10:27 - Ashwin: and people like genuine people
1/13/22, 10:28 - Tanushree: It's just me moderating what and how i say things
1/13/22, 10:28 - Ashwin: yes
1/13/22, 10:28 - Ashwin: thats everyone for you
1/13/22, 10:28 - Ashwin: princess
1/13/22, 10:28 - Tanushree: Sometimes it's easier
1/13/22, 10:29 - Ashwin: easier
1/13/22, 10:29 - Ashwin: ?
1/13/22, 10:29 - Tanushree: Sometimes it easier doing that
1/13/22, 10:29 - Tanushree: Moderating
1/13/22, 10:29 - Ashwin: yes
1/13/22, 10:29 - Ashwin: and other times
1/13/22, 10:29 - Tanushree: 😂

1/13/22, 10:30 - Tanushree: Like she invited two people
1/13/22, 10:30 - Tanushree: I didn't want on a trip
1/13/22, 10:30 - Ashwin: okay
1/13/22, 10:30 - Tanushree: And when i asked that we weren't going to invite them
1/13/22, 10:30 - Tanushree: She said
1/13/22, 10:30 - Tanushree: Ab toh bula liya
1/13/22, 10:30 - Ashwin: did you tell it to her
1/13/22, 10:30 - Tanushree: What sorta stupid thing is this to say?

1/13/22, 10:31 - Tanushree: Baat yahi hai yaar
1/13/22, 10:32 - Tanushree: I don't think she tried to consider.
1/13/22, 10:32 - Tanushree: And it's not her fault
1/13/22, 10:32 - Tanushree: I'm not blaming her
1/13/22, 10:32 - Ashwin: nhi it would let her know that it was adjustmenton your part
1/13/22, 10:32 - Tanushree: It's just she things, samne wala wants what she wants
1/13/22, 10:32 - Tanushree: And i could've said things
1/13/22, 10:32 - Ashwin: and she would be grateful for you to have taken the effort
1/13/22, 10:33 - Ashwin: she couldnt uninvite them
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Letting people feel they did something they should've have?
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Or she could?
1/13/22, 10:33 - Ashwin: no
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Atleast ask us?
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Before inviting?
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Like
1/13/22, 10:33 - Ashwin: what sort of a monster do you think she is
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Try to consider there are other people
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: And not just her
1/13/22, 10:33 - Ashwin: yes this she shouldve done
1/13/22, 10:33 - Ashwin: but is it an example?
1/13/22, 10:33 - Tanushree: Yes
1/13/22, 10:34 - Tanushree: It's an example
1/13/22, 10:34 - Tanushree: Which is old
1/13/22, 10:34 - Ashwin: because trip is long over
1/13/22, 10:34 - Tanushree: 😂
1/13/22, 10:34 - Tanushree: I'm over it
1/13/22, 10:34 - Tanushree: That's why using it as an example
1/13/22, 10:34 - Ashwin: yeah
1/13/22, 10:34 - Ashwin: similarly
1/13/22, 10:34 - Ashwin: its good to show your s\disapproval sometimes
1/13/22, 10:34 - Ashwin: and still get along
1/13/22, 10:34 - Tanushree: I guess
1/13/22, 10:35 - Tanushree: I don't know
1/13/22, 10:35 - Tanushree: How to show it properly
1/13/22, 10:35 - Ashwin: talk to her properly

1/13/22, 12:48 - Ashwin: I saw Emily in Paris. It would seem relatable to diverse set of groups. People going out somewhere to work. Working with a mean workplace. Long distance relationship etc. So it seems reasonable that your friends would like it.

1/17/22, 18:31 - Tanushree: And I'm not at the end of midnight mass

1/17/22, 18:31 - Ashwin: Nice
1/17/22, 18:31 - Tanushree: 🤭
1/18/22, 08:33 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/18/22, 08:35 - Tanushree: Would you read this paper with me? I am understanding few things and not others. Apko pata hi honge concepts so shouldnt take long also.
1/18/22, 13:40 - Ashwin: Yes maam
1/18/22, 13:40 - Ashwin: You free today eve?
1/18/22, 13:40 - Ashwin: Have half day today
1/18/22, 19:14 - Tanushree: you had night and work today also? ☹️
1/18/22, 19:14 - Tanushree: I'll make time whenever your free (except if I'll be sleeping)
1/18/22, 20:36 - Tanushree: He replied to my draft. He excluded eye tracker and eeg, bcoz it's not relevant for the study.
I agree with him, it's not relevant. But i don't wanna do a more neuroscience than psychology. I don't think they wanna do anything neurosciency.
1/18/22, 20:47 - Ashwin: Well
1/18/22, 20:48 - Ashwin: You first of all stop and take an honest appraisal of yourself that whether you have become biased against going and working with him
1/18/22, 20:48 - Ashwin: Interest change over time. It's more about the effort you put in and the opportunities
1/18/22, 20:49 - Ashwin: I wouldn't mind working on nlp or rl or cnns. These are all different branches of ml. But I am genuinely curious about learning. And once I get into something I know I will gain a bit expertise. And with expertise comes interest.
1/18/22, 20:50 - Ashwin: You may reply with why should I work when I have not interest?

1. He replied to your proposal meaning he is considering you seriously.

2. Criminal psychology is such a cool field. You may even get to feture in crime dramas that you like.
1/18/22, 20:51 - Tanushree: They are different branches of ML
But psychology is not a branch of neuroscience. I don't wanna cut down on neuro in future, i wanna include it more
1/18/22, 20:51 - Tanushree: Not against him. His conventional approach
1/18/22, 20:52 - Tanushree: Let's see
1/18/22, 20:53 - Tanushree: He has asked if i wanna meet. Imma say yes and ask stupid things 😂
1/18/22, 20:54 - Tanushree: I have been reading papers and it's feels like people in neuro field are doing something too futuristic while people in psychology are just changing the sequence of a design to see what happens 😂
1/18/22, 20:54 - Tanushree: I'm just biased tho. Let's see
1/18/22, 22:24 - Ashwin: Okay ☺
1/18/22, 22:24 - Ashwin: Just look at this opportunity for what it is
1/18/22, 22:26 - Tanushree: About time you start supporting my emotions 🐱
1/18/22, 22:29 - Ashwin: 🙂🙂🙂
1/18/22, 22:29 - Ashwin: I'll play the devils advocate a little longer
1/18/22, 22:30 - Tanushree: It's not your fault. It's normal for people to think psychology and neuroscience are similar fields
1/18/22, 22:31 - Ashwin: Oookay
1/18/22, 22:31 - Ashwin: So its not?
1/18/22, 22:31 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/18/22, 22:31 - Ashwin: Like AI and ml are seprate
1/18/22, 22:31 - Ashwin: But aren't similar
1/18/22, 22:31 - Ashwin: Anar is good !
1/18/22, 22:31 - Ashwin: Healthy diet
1/18/22, 22:32 - Tanushree: Idk what AI and ML are 😂😂 sounds like buzz words to me. When i try to learn, looks like statistics and programming to me 😂
1/18/22, 22:32 - Ashwin: Okay okay
1/18/22, 22:32 - Ashwin: 🙄
1/18/22, 22:32 - Tanushree: Whatt?
1/18/22, 22:32 - Tanushree: Correct me if I'm wrong
1/18/22, 22:33 - Tanushree: 😵
1/18/22, 22:33 - Ashwin: Ai is the overall ambit
1/18/22, 22:33 - Ashwin: Of machine that have capability to arrive at their own decisions
1/18/22, 22:33 - Tanushree: So i don't go and say something stupid in front of someone hot who knows more than me 😍
1/18/22, 22:33 - Ashwin: Machine learning is a subset of AI
1/18/22, 22:34 - Ashwin: Machine learning includes system for making the machine learn on task through supervised and unsupervised learning
1/18/22, 22:34 - Ashwin: Expert system for example comes under ai but is separate than machine learning
1/18/22, 22:34 - Ashwin: 🥰
1/18/22, 22:34 - Tanushree: Expert system?
1/18/22, 22:34 - Tanushree: Kya hota?
1/18/22, 22:34 - Ashwin: Like in 1980s
1/18/22, 22:35 - Ashwin: They took doctors opinions all over and came up with a system for diagnosis
1/18/22, 22:35 - Ashwin: It was basically a set of standard procedure that needed to be followed for identification of diseases
1/18/22, 22:35 - Ashwin: It had nothing about machine taking decisions but more like following a glow chart
1/18/22, 22:36 - Ashwin: Flow chart
1/18/22, 22:36 - Ashwin: But since the machine gave intelligent input to doctors
1/18/22, 22:36 - Ashwin: It came under artificial intelligence and since it was made through experts on the fields
1/18/22, 22:36 - Ashwin: Such systems are called expert systems
1/18/22, 22:36 - Tanushree: Acha
1/18/22, 22:37 - Tanushree: So when we do arrange data beautifully and try to predict what comes next
1/18/22, 22:37 - Tanushree: How is it different from machine learning?
1/18/22, 22:37 - Ashwin: Arrange beautifully is data transformation and exploratory data analysis
1/18/22, 22:38 - Ashwin: Prediction of what comes next
1/18/22, 22:38 - Ashwin: If done through algorithms
1/18/22, 22:38 - Ashwin: Like pca or linear regression for ml
1/18/22, 22:38 - Ashwin: Then that will be under machine learning
1/18/22, 22:38 - Tanushree: What exactly we mean by an algorithm? 😢
1/18/22, 22:38 - Tanushree: In college we learned, anything done in a systematic and stepwise manner is algorithm
1/18/22, 22:38 - Ashwin: Algorithms are basically steps to a tackle a problem
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: True
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: But in machine learning case
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: Suppose your objective us to reach a solution
1/18/22, 22:39 - Tanushree: You wanna call?
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: Yeah
1/18/22, 22:39 - Tanushree: I hope I'm wasting your time
1/18/22, 22:39 - Tanushree: Especially on texts
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: Yes
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: Yes
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: Yes
1/18/22, 22:39 - Ashwin: Yes

1/21/22, 14:00 - Ashwin: We used support vector machines
1/21/22, 14:02 - Ashwin: 😁😁
1/21/22, 14:09 - Tanushree: Well, I am assuming there's a difference. Why use one over the other?
1/21/22, 14:41 - Ashwin: Why does it always seem like you speak from a high horse
1/21/22, 14:41 - Ashwin: Yes there is a significant difference

1/21/22, 14:44 - Ashwin: I just asked why
1/21/22, 14:44 - Tanushree: It's normal for me
1/21/22, 14:44 - Ashwin: Aristocratic demeanor
1/21/22, 14:45 - Ashwin: Is natural to girls from rich family
1/21/22, 14:45 - Tanushree: You know how 'aristocratic' my behaviour is
1/21/22, 14:45 - Tanushree: Truly rich
1/21/22, 14:45 - Ashwin: Yes maam

1/21/22, 14:46 - Tanushree: No it's okay
1/21/22, 14:46 - Tanushree: I'll be more careful
1/21/22, 14:46 - Tanushree: I didn't know
1/21/22, 14:46 - Ashwin: Why would I
1/21/22, 14:46 - Ashwin: Oh man
1/21/22, 14:47 - Ashwin: Don't take it all so seriously
1/21/22, 14:47 - Ashwin: You are setting a dangerous precedent
1/21/22, 14:47 - Tanushree: Lol
1/21/22, 14:47 - Tanushree: You said it's off
1/21/22, 14:47 - Tanushree: I said I'll try not to 🤭
1/21/22, 14:48 - Ashwin: You know what you say might displease people but  changing according to them is not the best strategy
1/21/22, 14:49 - Tanushree: I'm not changing
1/21/22, 14:49 - Ashwin: People who piss you off stand out with their personality
1/21/22, 14:49 - Tanushree: Just modulating
1/21/22, 14:49 - Ashwin: That's just a euphemism
1/21/22, 14:49 - Tanushree: I can speak in various tones
1/21/22, 14:49 - Ashwin: Yes. When you change your tone to talk to people
1/21/22, 14:49 - Ashwin: Very obviously
1/21/22, 14:50 - Ashwin: People might also feel you are patronizing
1/21/22, 14:50 - Ashwin: Or not being yourself
1/21/22, 14:50 - Ashwin: It's all a very thin ljne
1/21/22, 14:50 - Tanushree: Very hard to manage
1/21/22, 14:50 - Tanushree: People will comment when I'll be me
1/21/22, 14:50 - Tanushree: Then they will comment when I'm not being me
1/21/22, 14:51 - Ashwin: Yes. So just be you.
1/21/22, 14:50 - Tanushree: Paradoxical
1/21/22, 14:51 - Tanushree: 😂
1/21/22, 14:51 - Tanushree: It's not a big deal
1/21/22, 14:51 - Ashwin: So atleats you can please you
1/21/22, 14:51 - Tanushree: You don't like it
1/21/22, 14:51 - Tanushree: I'll tone down

1/22/22, 11:37 - Ashwin: is odt cross platform
1/22/22, 11:37 - Tanushree: Honestly i don't know the difference between two, i use them interchangeably 😂
1/22/22, 11:38 - Ashwin: odt is another format used
1/22/22, 11:38 - Ashwin: usually linux users save in odt
1/22/22, 11:38 - Ashwin: but it also opens in word
1/22/22, 11:38 - Tanushree: He left a lasting impress you can say
Or I'm just obsessive
1/22/22, 11:38 - Ashwin: but the formatting changes between doc and odt
1/22/22, 11:38 - Tanushree: Ohh
1/22/22, 11:38 - Ashwin: so you need to be careful
1/22/22, 11:38 - Ashwin: i wanna be like that with my interactions
1/22/22, 11:38 - Tanushree: He just needs to see if my writing is fine
1/22/22, 11:39 - Ashwin: what about extra marks for good formating
1/22/22, 11:39 - Ashwin: this is the digital age anyway
1/22/22, 11:39 - Tanushree: No mostly Bcoz i liked his research work and he came off as caring 
Most supervisors don't come off as caring
1/22/22, 11:39 - Tanushree: It may not be more than that
1/22/22, 11:39 - Tanushree: I'll change that later
1/22/22, 11:39 - Tanushree: Professors don't do that.
1/22/22, 11:40 - Ashwin: Aman might feel threatened if its more

1/24/22, 18:40 - Tanushree: We all are
1/24/22, 18:41 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>

1/24/22, 18:43 - Tanushree: 😂
1/24/22, 18:52 - Ashwin: Nice presentation
1/24/22, 18:52 - Ashwin: It is easy
1/24/22, 18:52 - Tanushree: Exactly
1/24/22, 18:52 - Tanushree: I love it when people cite their sources
1/24/22, 18:52 - Tanushree: 😂
1/24/22, 18:53 - Ashwin: Yeah 😂
1/24/22, 19:53 - Ashwin: I read abstract of what you sent
1/24/22, 19:53 - Ashwin: It seems interesting
1/24/22, 19:53 - Ashwin: I can explain
1/24/22, 19:53 - Ashwin: But what is internal and external responses
1/24/22, 20:21 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
1/24/22, 20:22 - Ashwin: <Media omitted>
1/25/22, 09:27 - Tanushree: I know vaguely. I can read more if you prefer
When asked about past, people give some answers which are relevant to it, but also add other obvious things or factual things, that's not relevant to the story, that's external
1/25/22, 09:28 - Tanushree: It seems interesting, but also hard to categorise. Aren't memories all subjective. I wonder how they are categorizing
1/25/22, 09:28 - Tanushree: But then shayad unhone ML/AI Kara hoga kuch. Toh meko laga apse puchti
1/25/22, 09:35 - Tanushree: What exactly they used? And have they provided datasets?
1/25/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: I know now
1/25/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: No they havent
1/25/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: They have used distilbert
1/25/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: Which is a model for nlp
1/25/22, 10:12 - Ashwin: They made reference to a colab notebook (similar to kaggle notebook)
1/25/22, 10:13 - Ashwin: They have done
1/25/22, 10:13 - Ashwin: They are just categorizing responses given by people about their memories
1/25/22, 10:15 - Tanushree: Achaaa
1/25/22, 10:15 - Tanushree: So what can one do bout it? Other than reading the paper?
1/25/22, 10:18 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/25/22, 10:43 - Tanushree: <Media omitted>
1/25/22, 11:15 - Ashwin: Try to find similar code to implement
1/25/22, 11:15 - Ashwin: If you get repo and data
1/25/22, 11:15 - Ashwin: I can implement the model
1/25/22, 11:15 - Ashwin: But they have used custom tokenizer too
1/25/22, 11:15 - Tanushree: Okay, I'll send them a mail after i have read the paper a little
1/25/22, 11:15 - Ashwin: Which we can get based on the text
1/25/22, 11:15 - Tanushree: Maybe they send. Who knows
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: That's umm yeah why not
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: I never tried it thougj
1/25/22, 11:16 - Tanushree: What is this?
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: Pandas and women
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: I mean I never email people
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: Asking fir code
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: But guidance is good
1/25/22, 11:16 - Ashwin: If you are really interested
1/25/22, 11:17 - Ashwin: We can make a project I  this
1/25/22, 11:17 - Ashwin: Okayy
1/25/22, 11:17 - Tanushree: I read it partially. They are talking a technique, meko wo bhi dekhna padega exactly kya
But it's interesting how they are categorizing subjective memory codes like this
1/25/22, 11:17 - Tanushree: I also don't. I have 3-4 time and got it 2 times. So not a bad bet
1/25/22, 11:17 - Ashwin: They are categorizing text
1/25/22, 11:17 - Ashwin: Nice
1/25/22, 11:18 - Ashwin: This is normal for nlp
1/25/22, 11:18 - Tanushree: You find them too han
1/25/22, 11:18 - Tanushree: I don't know abc of nlp
1/25/22, 11:18 - Ashwin: But nlp has nlp
1/25/22, 11:18 - Ashwin: Not abc
1/25/22, 11:18 - Ashwin: 😂
1/25/22, 11:18 - Tanushree: 🙂

2/4/22, 02:46 - Tanushree: Remember that NLP wala paper where they were categorising the memory texts into groups??
So I was going through his profile and I couldn't find much, it was updated. Before sending a mail I went through his social media.
But I found a link of his GitHub on his GFs twitter account. Let me share. You may see if you get time.
2/4/22, 02:47 - Tanushree: https://github.com/rubenvangenugten/autobiographical_interview_scoring
2/4/22, 02:51 - Tanushree: I don't think they have provided data (makes sense bcoz human data is not generally shared). 
What sort of data is required tho? Can we not just put any text??
2/4/22, 03:56 - Tanushree: https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/father-makes-timetable-for-his-6-year-old-son-561012.html you

2/4/22, 06:58 - Tanushree: Sarcastic?
2/4/22, 06:59 - Ashwin: slightly
2/4/22, 06:59 - Tanushree: It's a genuine concern for me
2/4/22, 06:59 - Tanushree: I don't understand written code
2/4/22, 07:02 - Ashwin: okay but first lets see if it works
2/4/22, 07:02 - Ashwin: he has a provate csv which he added
2/4/22, 07:02 - Ashwin: but there is also a synthetic csv present
2/4/22, 07:02 - Ashwin: ill try and work with that
2/4/22, 07:02 - Tanushree: Achaa
2/4/22, 07:02 - Tanushree: Okayy

2/4/22, 07:29 - Ashwin: so we need to make modification
2/4/22, 07:29 - Ashwin: as far as understanding the code goes ill try and add comments

2/4/22, 13:08 - Ashwin: Bacche ? Kiske bacche
2/4/22, 13:09 - Ashwin: Data is already there in csv format to just see how the code runs. But the code is faulty like always. It happens because tools are not static and they keep changing. So you can't run the same tool again and again and expect same results
2/4/22, 13:10 - Ashwin: *taking notes*
2/4/22, 13:22 - Tanushree: This is done by a PhD student. So ya bache 😂
2/4/22, 13:22 - Tanushree: Why the fuck they change it?

2/4/22, 22:50 - Tanushree: Anything more than 0.05 would do
2/4/22, 22:50 - Tanushree: But 0.3 is far away 🤭
2/4/22, 22:52 - Ashwin: It means it's statically insignificant right
2/4/22, 22:52 - Tanushree: Yess
2/4/22, 22:52 - Ashwin: Anything less
2/4/22, 22:52 - Tanushree: For the status
2/4/22, 22:53 - Tanushree: Warna han, hona toh 0.05 se kam hi chaiye 😂😂
2/4/22, 22:53 - Ashwin: 😂🐱
2/4/22, 22:53 - Ashwin: So there is no true lub
2/4/22, 22:53 - Ashwin: Only statistics
2/4/22, 22:54 - Tanushree: Statistically seeing, the likelihood is very low
2/4/22, 22:54 - Tanushree: 🙂
2/4/22, 22:54 - Tanushree: Considering true lub is more rare than common
2/4/22, 22:54 - Ashwin: How do you know true lub
2/4/22, 22:55 - Ashwin: Have you ever felt it
2/4/22, 22:55 - Ashwin: Or is it just a romantic hypothesis
2/4/22, 22:55 - Tanushree: Intuition
2/4/22, 22:56 - Tanushree: I have felt is so many times it has no value left 😂
2/4/22, 22:56 - Ashwin: Ohh🐱
2/4/22, 22:56 - Ashwin: Explain to me next time
2/4/22, 22:56 - Tanushree: 🙂
2/4/22, 22:56 - Ashwin: You know that true lub is not  a crush
2/4/22, 22:57 - Tanushree: Pehle khud istaam karein phir vishwas karein
2/4/22, 22:57 - Tanushree: Idk what it is 😂😂
2/4/22, 22:57 - Tanushree: It just feels like it in the moment
2/4/22, 23:03 - Ashwin: Hmm I've only felt crushes
2/4/22, 23:04 - Ashwin: I hope it's not the same thing :(
2/4/22, 23:04 - Ashwin: Wow so descriptive
2/4/22, 23:04 - Tanushree: No, it's not the same
2/4/22, 23:05 - Tanushree: Abhi how can I describe exactly 😂😂
2/4/22, 23:06 - Tanushree: It's more intense. More about company. You feel freer. Ill try some other day to describe 😂😂😂
2/4/22, 23:06 - Tanushree: Or just ask some of your friend. Most people have felt it i guess
2/4/22, 23:06 - Ashwin: Ohh 🙂🙂
2/4/22, 23:07 - Ashwin: Freedom is love
2/4/22, 23:07 - Ashwin: Lemme check with the friends who didn't come at my birthday party
2/4/22, 23:07 - Tanushree: This is exactly what aman thought when he started the relationship
2/4/22, 23:07 - Tanushree: Now he knows better 😂😂😂
2/4/22, 23:07 - Ashwin: Hiw
2/4/22, 23:07 - Ashwin: Hoe
2/4/22, 23:07 - Ashwin: Haw
2/4/22, 23:07 - Tanushree: You make faces 😂
2/4/22, 23:08 - Ashwin: I mean
2/4/22, 23:08 - Ashwin: How
2/4/22, 23:08 - Tanushree: 😧
2/4/22, 23:08 - Ashwin: 🐱
2/4/22, 23:08 - Ashwin: Like a cat face?
2/4/22, 23:08 - Ashwin: Not a cute face
2/4/22, 23:08 - Tanushree: Do I look like a gf who gives freedom? 😂
2/4/22, 23:08 - Ashwin: Yes
2/4/22, 23:08 - Tanushree: You felt repulsed when I talked about gifts
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: I didn't want to trouble you
2/4/22, 23:09 - Tanushree: Like "Is chutiya bandi ko kya samjh ni aara jab me bolra hu that I don't celebrate?"
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: But yeah let's drop that subject
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: Nhi.
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: But theek h
2/4/22, 23:09 - Tanushree: It didn't seem like "oh that's alright, I don't wanna trouble"
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: Haan okayyy
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: By god
2/4/22, 23:09 - Ashwin: Let's come back to this
2/4/22, 23:10 - Ashwin: 😂
2/4/22, 23:10 - Tanushree: Do I?
2/4/22, 23:10 - Tanushree: 🙂
2/4/22, 23:10 - Ashwin: You do allow
2/4/22, 23:10 - Ashwin: A lot of his shenanigans
2/4/22, 23:11 - Tanushree: Like? 😂
2/4/22, 23:11 - Ashwin: Like you understand why he can't come to meet you everytime
2/4/22, 23:11 - Tanushree: Being understanding and giving freedom is not the same
2/4/22, 23:11 - Ashwin: And other stuff which I feel would be necessary in a relationship with two dynamic duos like you
2/4/22, 23:12 - Ashwin: It is one and the same
2/4/22, 23:12 - Tanushree: If you don't wanna do stuff, fine. I'll be patient
2/4/22, 23:12 - Tanushree: But you wanna do stuff? Nope. Not until I'm comfortable 😂
2/4/22, 23:12 - Ashwin: That's his freedom of choice you are granting
2/4/22, 23:12 - Ashwin: That's freedom exactly
2/4/22, 23:12 - Ashwin: Man do you understand freedom
2/4/22, 23:12 - Ashwin: It's anti slavery
2/4/22, 23:12 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
2/4/22, 23:13 - Ashwin: And understanding each other's point of view
2/4/22, 23:13 - Ashwin: That you are doing
2/4/22, 23:13 - Ashwin: Theek h you don't allow him to watch TV without you
2/4/22, 23:13 - Tanushree: There are alot of things I don't understand
2/4/22, 23:13 - Ashwin: But that's a sort of your shenanigans that's necessary in a relationship to feel personal
2/4/22, 23:13 - Tanushree: I hated it that he took Netflix account from his friend
2/4/22, 23:13 - Tanushree: Bcoz I didn't like her
2/4/22, 23:13 - Tanushree: 🥲
2/4/22, 23:14 - Ashwin: But he still did right
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: Nope
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: He did
2/4/22, 23:14 - Ashwin: What did she ever do to you though
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: For a few months
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: Little things. Nothing significant
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: But I just didn't like her
2/4/22, 23:14 - Ashwin: A really stuffy gf would not have allowed even that
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: No no
2/4/22, 23:14 - Tanushree: He did that
2/4/22, 23:15 - Ashwin: Yeah sometimes you have this feeling about people
2/4/22, 23:15 - Tanushree: But I was very complaining about that
2/4/22, 23:15 - Ashwin: I wonder how it comes
2/4/22, 23:15 - Ashwin: Well complaining is allright. It's a way to earn brownie point
2/4/22, 23:15 - Tanushree: Yaa.
2/4/22, 23:15 - Tanushree: Complaining to a point he stopped doing
2/4/22, 23:16 - Tanushree: I'm not comfortable with alot of people.
2/4/22, 23:16 - Tanushree: It's a red flag
2/4/22, 23:16 - Tanushree: In me
2/4/22, 23:16 - Tanushree: Definitely
2/4/22, 23:16 - Ashwin: See stopping something you didn't like isn't restricting his freedom. He was considerate towards his feelings so he stopped
2/4/22, 23:16 - Ashwin: Nothing wrong with thay
2/4/22, 23:16 - Tanushree: Youd know if something happened with you
2/4/22, 23:16 - Tanushree: 🥲🥲
2/4/22, 23:16 - Ashwin: Huh
2/4/22, 23:17 - Ashwin: Yeah it's bound to happen
2/4/22, 23:17 - Tanushree: Also I feel, I seem more possessive bcoz aman is not at all
2/4/22, 23:17 - Tanushree: I wanted him to stop talking to a girl bcoz she flirted with him
2/4/22, 23:18 - Tanushree: And aman lets me be friends with people bcoz he feels I am an adult and know what to do
2/4/22, 23:18 - Tanushree: Soooo
2/4/22, 23:18 - Tanushree: One is a mature person, another is not
2/4/22, 23:18 - Tanushree: Yay, love to see that 😂
2/4/22, 23:18 - Ashwin: Another is mature enough to understand that the other person is mature enough?
2/4/22, 23:18 - Tanushree: Yes
2/4/22, 23:18 - Ashwin: It's a balance
2/4/22, 23:18 - Ashwin: You both complement each other
2/4/22, 23:19 - Tanushree: And I'm not mature enough to understand that he will do which is right
2/4/22, 23:19 - Ashwin: That's why you are sustaining the relationship
2/4/22, 23:19 - Tanushree: I decide things for him if I'm not comfortable
2/4/22, 23:19 - Tanushree: We didn't
2/4/22, 23:19 - Tanushree: We broke up
2/4/22, 23:19 - Ashwin: Abhi tum bhi bilkul aise ho jaati ki kuch farak nhi padta toh there is no intimacy left
2/4/22, 23:19 - Ashwin: When
2/4/22, 23:19 - Tanushree: No no
2/4/22, 23:20 - Ashwin: Like on a break
2/4/22, 23:20 - Tanushree: I just know our flaws
2/4/22, 23:20 - Tanushree: Very well
2/4/22, 23:20 - Ashwin: Woh toh Ross bhi tha
2/4/22, 23:20 - Ashwin: Okay
2/4/22, 23:20 - Tanushree: And since we know and have experienced them, we handle better
2/4/22, 23:20 - Tanushree: 😢
2/4/22, 23:20 - Tanushree: Ya
2/4/22, 23:20 - Ashwin: Hmm thats maturity
2/4/22, 23:20 - Ashwin: In a relationship as a whole
2/4/22, 23:20 - Ashwin: There is no stuffiness
2/4/22, 23:21 - Ashwin: Because there is no friction
2/4/22, 23:21 - Ashwin: Thats why you can't say I don't give room to aman
2/4/22, 23:21 - Ashwin: Because perhaps that's exactly the sort of girl who would compliment him
2/4/22, 23:21 - Ashwin: I can be a tees maar khaann
2/4/22, 23:21 - Tanushree: He would love to have some room 😂
2/4/22, 23:21 - Ashwin: But if I don't find a girl who is ready to adjust it will fail
2/4/22, 23:22 - Ashwin: Elven if we both are ambitious and hardworking and objectively (subjectively?) Good persons
2/4/22, 23:22 - Ashwin: Oyo 🙂
2/4/22, 23:22 - Tanushree: 😂😂😂
2/4/22, 23:22 - Ashwin: 🤓
2/4/22, 23:22 - Tanushree: I used to be understanding and very mature before breakup
2/4/22, 23:23 - Tanushree: Now, it seems like I am doing what I used to
2/4/22, 23:23 - Tanushree: He is doing everything. And he doesn't, I won't
2/4/22, 23:23 - Ashwin: Hmm okay
2/4/22, 23:23 - Ashwin: I don't know what we're your reasons for break up
2/4/22, 23:24 - Ashwin: But good that you guys learnt
2/4/22, 23:24 - Ashwin: This looks like an ultimatum tho
2/4/22, 23:24 - Ashwin: 😂
