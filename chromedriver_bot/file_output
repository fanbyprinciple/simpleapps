Text Summarization on HuggingFaceSummarization is basically of two types i.e. Abstractive and Extractive Summarization. Here we will cover both types and will see how we can finetune pretrained T5 transformers on particular dataset.Yugal Jain1. Introduction Summarization is a task of getting short summaries from long documents i.e. news articles or research articles. Basically it can be of two types i.e. Extractive and abstractive summarization.Extractive Summarization - Extractive Summarization is a shortening of paragraphs in large documents i.e. news articles, medical publications or research articles throught extracting important information from those documents without keeping context in mind.Abstractive Summarization - Abstractive Summarization is quite different from prior basic summarization technique. In prior summarization, resulting summaries may or maynot be meaningful because it's just a process of extracting important sentences from long documents but in abstractive summarization , resulting summaries tries to consider context for whole document and then summarize it accordingly where words maynot be exact similar to given documents. That's why abstractive summarization is commonly used for summarizing news articles. For e.g. inshorts app uses abstractive summarization system to summarize news into short summaries.Try out in Colab2. DatasetWe will use Cnn-Daily News Summary dataset here to perform summarization using T5 pretrained model. T5 is a text-to-text transfer transformer model which is trained on unlabelled and labelled data and further finetuned to individual tasks for language modelling. Here we will use T5-small pretrained model to finetune it on wikihow dataset for summarization task.Custom DataClass	class CustomDataset(Dataset):
source = self.tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([text],max_length=self.text_len,return_tensors='pt',pad_to_max_length=True) # Each source sequence is encoded and padded to max length in batches
target = self.tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([summary],max_length=self.summ_len,return_tensors='pt',pad_to_max_length=True) # Each target sequence is encoded and padded to max lenght in batches
}3. Pretrained ModelThere are basically two architectures are commonly used for summarization i.e. T5 and BART based. In our case we will go for T5 i.e. Text to Text Transfer Transformer based pretrained model. We will use T5ForConditionalGeneration architecture as pretrained model and T5TokenizerFast as tokenizer.4. TrainingNow after creating custom dataclass to load and preprocess summary dataset, we will finetune T5 model for summary generation.def train(epoch,model,tokenizer,loader,optimizer,device):
y_ids = y[:,:-1].contiguous() # all ids except last one
lm_labels = y[:,1:].clone().detach() # copy the address and detach label
lm_labels[y[:,1:]==tokenizer.pad_token_id] = -100 # if it's padded token then assign it to -100
outputs = model(input_ids = source_ids,attention_mask = masks,decoder_input_ids=y_ids,labels=lm_labels)
wandb.log({'training_loss':loss}) # Saving logs after every 10 steps or batches
loss.backward() # optimize weights through backpropagation loss
optimizer.step()5. EvaluationFinally after training, it's time to evaluate model on validation data. def validation(epoch,tokenizer,model,device,loader):
preds = [tokenizer.decode(p,skip_special_tokens=True,clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False) for p in prediction]
target = [tokenizer.decode(t,skip_special_tokens=True,clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False) for t in y_id]
return predictions,actual6. IntegrationCalling all defined functions above here in main function.def main():
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
We will use cnn_dailymail summarization dataset for abstractive summarization #
# As we can observe, dataset is too large so for now we will consider just 8k rows for training and 4k rows for validation
dataset['article'] = [re.sub('\(.*?\)','',t) for t in dataset['article']]
dataset['article'] = [t.replace('--','') for t in dataset['article']]
