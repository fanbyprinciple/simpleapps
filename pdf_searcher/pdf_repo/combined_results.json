These names have been arranged in  \nEnglish alphabetical order. The Latin name (taxonomical nomenclature) of each drug as  \nfound  in authentic  scientific  literature has  been provided  in the monograph  in  the  \nintroductory paragraph. The official name will be the main title of the drug and its  \nscientific name will also be considered as legal name.\nIntroductory Para  - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating  \nthe part, scientific name of the drug in Latin with short description about its habit,  \ndistribution and method of collection, if any.\nSynonyms - Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English,  \nHindi, Urdu and other Indian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the  \nclassical texts,  Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II as procured from the  \nexperts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the field from different states.\nItalics - Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appearing in the  \nintroductory  paragraph  of  each  monograph  as  also  for  chemicals  and  reagents,  \nsubstances or processes described in Appendix.\nOdour and Taste - Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned  \nbut the description as \u2018 odourless\u2019 or \u2018no odour\u2019 has in many cases been avoided in the  \ndescription,  as large numbers of drugs have got no specific  odour. The \u201codour\u201d is \nexamined by directly smelling 25 g of the powdered drug contained in a package or  \nfreshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly transferred to an open  \ncontainer and re-examined after 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is  \ndescribed as having odour.\nThe \u201cTaste\u201d of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder  \nby a tip of moist glass rod and applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This  \nmay not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated in monograph.\nMesh Number - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve \u201cMesh  \nNumber 85\u201d has been used. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance.  \nWeights and Measures -  The metric system of weights and measures is employed.  \nWeights are given in multiples or fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid  \nmeasures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre (ml).\nWhen the term \u201cdrop\u201d is used, the measurement is to be made by means of a  \ntube, which delivers in 20 drops 1 gram of distilled water at 15oC.\nMetric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at 20oC and \nall  measurements  involved  in  the  analytical  operations  of  the  Pharmacopoeia  are  \nintended, unless otherwise stated to be made at that temperature.\nIdentity, Purity and Strength - Under the heading \u201cIdentification\u201d tests are provided  \nas an aid to identification and are described in their respective monographs.\nviii"}, {"file": "API-Vol-2.pdf", "page_number": 9, "text": "The term \u201cForeign Matter\u201d is used to designate any matter, which does not form  \npart of the drug as defined in the monograph.

The  methods  for  assays  are  described  in  their  respective  \nmonographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of  \nmonographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given.

In  suitable  instances  the  methods  of  microanalysis,  if  of  \nequivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described. However, in  \nthe event of doubt or dispute the methods of analysis of the Pharmacopoeia are alone  \nauthoritative.\nLimits for Heavy Metals  \u2013 All Ayurvedic Drugs (Single/Compound formulation) must  \ncomply with the limits for Heavy Metals prescribed in individual Monograph and wherever  \nlimit is not given then they must comply with the limits given in WHO publication  \n\u201cQuality Control Methods for Medicinal Plants and Material\u201d.\nStandards - For statutory purpose, statements appearing in the API, Part-I, Vol. V,  \nunder Description, those of definition of the part and source plants, and Identity, Purity  \nand Strength, shall constitute standards. \nThin Layer Chromatography ( T.L.C.) - Under this head, wherever given, the number  \nof spots and Rf values of the spots with their colour have been mentioned as a guide for  \nidentification of the drug and not as Pharmacopoeial requirement. However, the analyst  \nmay use any other solvent system and detecting reagent in any instance if he is satisfied  \nthat the method which he uses, even by applying known reference standards, will give  \nbetter result to establish the identity of any particular chemical constituent reported to  \nbe present in the drug.\nQuantities to be weighed for Assays and Tests - In all description quantity of the  \nsubstance to be taken for testing is indicated. The amount stated is approximate but the  \nquantity actually used must be accurately weighed and must not deviate by more than  \n10 per cent from the one stated.\nConstant Weight -  the term \u201cConstant Weight\u201d when it refers to drying or ignition  \nmeans that two consecutive weighings do not differ by more than 1.0 mg per g of the  \nsubstance taken for the determination, the second weighing following an additional hour  \nof drying on further ignition.\nConstituents - Under this head only the names of important chemical constituents,  \ngroups of constituents reported in research publications have been mentioned as a guide  \nand not as pharmacopoeial requirement.\nPercentage of Solutions -  In defining standards, the expression per cent (%), is used,  \naccording to circumstances, with one of the four meanings given below.\nPer cent w/w (percentage weight in weight) expresses the number of grammes of \nactive substance, in 100 grammes of product.        \nix"}, {"file": "API-Vol-2.pdf", "page_number": 10, "text": "Per cent w/v (Percentage weight in volume) expresses the number of grammes of \nactive substance in 100 millilitres of product.        \nPer cent v/v (percentage volume in volume) expresses the number of millilitres of \nactive substance in 100 millilitres of product.        \n         Per cent v/w (percentage volume in weight) expresses the number of millilitres of \nactive substance in 100 grammes of product. \nPercentage of alcohol  - All statements of percentage of alcohol ( C2H5OH) refer to \npercentage by volume at 15.56 oC.        \nTemperature - Unless otherwise specified all temperatures refer to centigrade ( celsius), \nthermometric scale.\nSolutions - Unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph, all solutions are  \nprepared with purified water.\nReagents  and  Solutions  -  The  chemicals  and  reagents  required  for  the  test  in  \nPharmacopoeia are described in Appendices.\nSolubility - When stating the solubilities of Chemical substances the term \u201cSoluble\u201d is  \nnecessarily sometimes used in a general sense irrespective of concomitant chemical  \nchanges.\nStatements of solubilities, which are expressed as a precise relation of weights of  \ndissolved substance of volume of solvent, at a stated temperature, are intended to apply  \nat that temperature.

These names have been arranged in  \nEnglish alphabetical order. The Latin name (taxonomical nomenclature) of each drug as  \nfound  in authentic  scientific  literature has  been provided  in the monograph  in  the  \nintroductory paragraph. The official name will be the main title of the drug and its  \nscientific name will also be considered as legal name.\nIntroductory Para  - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating  \nthe part, scientific name of the drug in Latin with short description about its habit,  \ndistribution and method of collection, if any.\nSynonyms - Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English,  \nHindi, Urdu and other Indian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the  \nclassical texts,  Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II as procured from the  \nexperts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the field from different states.\nItalics - Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appearing in the  \nintroductory  paragraph  of  each  monograph  as  also  for  chemicals  and  reagents,  \nsubstances or processes described in Appendix.\nOdour and Taste - Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned  \nbut the description as \u2018 odourless\u2019 or \u2018no odour\u2019 has in many cases been avoided in the  \ndescription,  as large numbers of drugs have got no specific  odour. The \u201codour\u201d is \nexamined by directly smelling 25 g of the powdered drug contained in a package or  \nfreshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly transferred to an open  \ncontainer and re-examined after 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is  \ndescribed as having odour.\nThe \u201cTaste\u201d of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder  \nby a tip of moist glass rod and applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This  \nmay not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated in monograph.\nMesh Number - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve \u201cMesh  \nNumber 85\u201d has been used. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance.  \nWeights and Measures -  The metric system of weights and measures is employed.  \nWeights are given in multiples or fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid  \nmeasures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre (ml).\nWhen the term \u201cdrop\u201d is used, the measurement is to be made by means of a  \ntube, which delivers in 20 drops 1 gram of distilled water at 15oC.\nMetric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at 20oC and \nall  measurements  involved  in  the  analytical  operations  of  the  Pharmacopoeia  are  \nintended, unless otherwise stated to be made at that temperature.\nIdentity, Purity and Strength - Under the heading \u201cIdentification\u201d tests are provided  \nas an aid to identification and are described in their respective monographs.\nThe term \u201cForeign Matter\u201d is used to designate any matter, which does not form  \npart of the drug as defined in the monograph.

The official name will be the main title of the drug and its  \nscientific name will also be considered as legal name.\nIntroductory Para  - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating  \nthe part, scientific name of the drug in Latin with short description about its habit,  \ndistribution and method of collection, if any.\nSynonyms - Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English,  \nHindi, Urdu and other Indian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the  \nclassical texts,  Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II as procured from the  \nexperts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the field from different states.\nItalics - Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appearing in the  \nintroductory  paragraph  of  each  monograph  as  also  for  chemicals  and  reagents,  \nsubstances or processes described in Appendix.\nOdour and Taste - Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned  \nbut the description as \u2018 odourless\u2019 or \u2018no odour\u2019 has in many cases been avoided in the  \ndescription,  as large numbers of drugs have got no specific  odour. The \u201codour\u201d is \nexamined by directly smelling 25 g of the powdered drug contained in a package or  \nfreshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly transferred to an open  \ncontainer and re-examined after 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is  \ndescribed as having odour.\nThe \u201cTaste\u201d of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder  \nby a tip of moist glass rod and applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This  \nmay not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated in monograph.\nMesh Number - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve \u201cMesh  \nNumber 85\u201d has been used. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance.  \nWeights and Measures -  The metric system of weights and measures is employed.  \nWeights are given in multiples or fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid  \nmeasures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre (ml).\nWhen the term \u201cdrop\u201d is used, the measurement is to be made by means of a  \ntube, which delivers in 20 drops 1 gram of distilled water at 15oC.\nMetric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at 20oC and \nall  measurements  involved  in  the  analytical  operations  of  the  Pharmacopoeia  are  \nintended, unless otherwise stated to be made at that temperature.\nIdentity, Purity and Strength - Under the heading \u201cIdentification\u201d tests are provided  \nas an aid to identification and are described in their respective monographs.\nviii"}, {"file": "API-Vol-4.pdf", "page_number": 9, "text": "The term \u201cForeign Matter\u201d is used to designate any matter, which does not form  \npart of the drug as defined in the monograph.

The  methods  for  assays  are  described  in  their  respective  \nmonographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of  \nmonographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given. The  \nanalyst is not precluded from employing an alternate method in any instance if he is  \nsatisfied  that  the  method,  which  he  uses,  will  give  the  same  result  as  the  \nPharmacopoeial Method.  In  suitable  instances  the  methods  of  microanalysis,  if  of  \nequivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described.

Add 10 g of powdered potassium sulphate, 0.5 g of powdered copper sulphate and  \n30 ml of nitrogen free sulphuric acid. Incline the flask at an angle of about 45 \u00b0 and \ngently heat the mixture, keeping the temperature below the boiling point of the mixture  \nuntil frothing has ceased. Increase the heat until the acid boils and continue the heating  \nfor four hrs until the solution acquires a clear greenish colour. Allow the mixture to cool,  \nadd 150 ml of water, thoroughly mix the contents of the flask and cool again. Add  \ncautiously, so as to cause the solution to flow down inside the flask to form a layer under  \nthe acid solution, 100 ml of a 30 % w/v solution of sodium hydroxide in water. Add a  \nfew pieces of granulated zinc, and connect the flask by means of kjeldahl connecting  \nbulb with a condenser, the delivery tube from which dips beneath the surface of a  \nmixture of 30 ml of 0.5 N HCl or 0.5 N H 2S04 and 25 ml of water contained in an  \nErlenmeyer flask or a wide mouthed bottle of about 500 ml capacity. Mix the contents of  \nthe flask by gentle rotation, and distil until about two thirds of the contents of the flask  \nhave distilled over. Add about 3 drops of solution of methyl red to the contents of the  \nreceiving  vessel  and  determine  the  excess  of  acid  by  titration  with  0.5  N  sodium  \nhydroxide. Repeat the experiment with the same quantities of reagents and in the same  \nmanner, but omitting the substance under test. The difference between the two titrations  \nrepresent the acid required to neutralize the ammonia. Each ml of 0.5 N hydrochloric  \nacid or 0.5 N Sulphuric acid is equivalent to 0.007004 g of N.\nWhen the nitrogen content of the substance under test is known to be low, 0.5 N  \nhydrochloric or 0.5 N sulphuric acid may be replaced by 0.1N hydrochloric acid or 0.1 N  \nsulphuric acid and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide should then be used in titrating the excess  \nacid.

Wher ever the abbreviation A.P.I. is used, it \nmay be presumed to stand for the same and the supplements thereto. \n \nName of the Drugs - The name given on the top of each monograph of the drug is in Sanskrit  as mentioned in the \nAyurvedic classics and/or in the Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I a nd Part-II will be considered official. These \nnames have been arranged in English alphabetical order. The Latin nam e (taxonomical nomenclature) of each drug \nas found in authentic scientific literature has been provided in the m onograph in the introductory paragraph. The \nofficial name will be the main title of the drug and its scientific name will a lso be considered as legal name. \n \nIntroductory Para  - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating the part, s cientific name of \nthe drug in Latin with short description about its habit, distribution and method of collection, if  any. \n \nSynonyms -  Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English, Hindi, Urdu and other \nIndian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the classical  texts, Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-\nI and Part-II as procured from the experts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the f ield from different states. \n \nItalics -  Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appeari ng in the introductory paragraph of each \nmonograph as also for chemicals and reagents, substances or processes described in Appe ndix. \n \nOdour and Taste -  Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned but the des cription as \n\u2018odourless\u2019 or \u2018no odour\u2019 has in many cases been avoided in the description, as larg e numbers of drugs have got no \nspecific odour. The \u201codour\u201d is examined by directly smelling 25 g of the  powdered drug contained in a package or \nfreshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly trans ferred to an open container and re-examined \nafter 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is described as having odour. \n \nThe \u201cTaste\u201d of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder by a tip of moist glass rod \nand applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This may not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated \nin monograph. \n \nMesh Number  - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve \u201cMesh Number 85\u201d has been \nused. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance.           \n \nWeights and Measures -  The metric system of weights and measures is employed. Weight s are given in multiples \nor fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid m easures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre \n(ml). \n \nWhen the term \u201cdrop\u201d is used, the measurement is to be made by means  of a tube, which delivers in 20 \ndrops 1 gram of distilled water at 15 oC. \n \nMetric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at 20 oC and all measurements \ninvolved in the analytical operations of the Pharmacopoeia are intende d, unless otherwise stated to be made at that \ntemperature. \n \nIdentity, Purity and Strength - Under the heading \u201cIdentification\u201d tests are provided as an aid t o identification \nand are described in their respective monographs. \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 11, "text": " XI  The term \u201cForeign Matter\u201d is used to designate any matter, which does not form par t of the drug as defined \nin the monograph. Vegetable drugs used as such or in formulations, should be dul y identified and authenticated and \nbe free from insects, pests, fungi, micro-organisms, pesticides, a nd other animal matter including animal excreta, \nbe within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, and show no abnormal odour, \ncolour, sliminess, mould or other evidence of deterioration. \n \nThe quantitative tests e.g. total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-sol uble ash, alcohol-soluble extractive, \nwater- soluble extractive, ether-soluble extractive, moisture content, volat ile oil content and assays are the methods \nupon which the standards of Pharmacopoeia depend.

India, due to its unique variety of geographical and climatic factor s, has a rich and varied flora of \nmedicinal plants since the dawn of civilization. No wonder that out of a total number of over 15,000 plant species \nin India about 2000 are known to have medicinal properties and some of them are used as home-remedies in the \nrural and remotest parts of the country. \n 2. The vastness of the country with its inadequate means of communica tion and facilities for transport of \ndrugs coupled with diverse regional languages, gave rise to a mult itude of synonyms (names in regional languages \nfor one species). Further, Ayurveda, being a dynamic professional scie nce, led to the successful use of several \nnewer drugs with therapeutic values similar to those which were originally equated with the classical Ayurvedic \ndrugs.   These later assumed the name of the very same classi cal drug and continued to be locally collected, sold \nand used in that name since the main drug was locally unavailable a nd substitution became a necessity. Later, in \nthe first half of the century, while scientifically identifying  the drugs in vogue in different regions, scientists found \nthat there were more than one species, belonging even to different f amilies of plants, claiming the same classical \nname of the Ayurvedic drug. \u2018Brahmi\u2019 could be cited as a good example. This created an impression that there \nexisted a great controversy about the real identity of Ayurvedic drugs .  Such drugs, were stamped as \u201ccontroversial \ndrugs\u201d without examining their potential as therapeutic equivalents. \n 3. Ayurveda had never been static. Its practitioners had been innovati ve and dynamic in therapeutic \npractice and tried out drugs from the local flora to discoverer new er medicines with the same therapeutic value as \nthe classical drugs.  These newer drugs were accepted by the then practising profe ssion as \u201csubstitutes\u201d. A study of \nAyurvedic literature, reveals several references permitti ng the use a substitute drug when the classical drug is not \navailable. Such recommendations are based on its therapeutic equivale nce, clinical efficacy, and on equivalent \nstatus of their Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka and Karma. \n 4. A few classical drugs of Himalayan origin were limited and seasonal in thei r occurrence. They could not \nbe grown on plains and hence their use was restricted. By the time they were identified their supply had dwindled \nand commercial substitution started. These drugs are the \u201cSandigdha D ravyas\u201d (drugs of doubtful identity) one of \nwhich is the \u2018Ashta Varga\u2019, consisting of 8 Single Drugs. \n 5. During the last 100 years of the alien rule social and economic c onditions in India changed due to of \nurbanisation. Ayurvedic physicians took to cities and lost their contac t with forests where their drug sources lay. As \na consequence of better transport facilities, trade in crude drugs be came easier and suppliers came between the \nAyurvedic physician and his personal collection of herbs.   Commercial  manufacture of Ayurvedic Medicines in \nfactories started. These were the inevitable consequences of the socio-economic changes in the country. The new \neconomic set up was such that the Ayurvedic practitioner could no longer  process and prepare his own medicines \nbut had to depend on the big pharmaceutical houses and the suppliers of crude dr ugs to whatever extent he needed \nthem. There was, in a way, a forced division of labour where he had no choice but to purchase his drugs and no \nmeans to ascertain the authenticity of the medicines and formulations offer ed to him by the pharmaceutical houses, \nnor was there any Governmental control on the manufacture to ensure the  quality of the medicines marketed, \nprescribed and administered to his patient. \n 6. As an outcome of the first Health Minister\u2019s Conference of 1946, a  Committee under the Chairmanship \nof Lt. Col. R.N. Chopra was appointed in 1946 by the Government of India. It wa s the Chopra Committee that had \nfirst gone into the question of need for proper identification of Ayurvedi c medicinal plants, control over collection \nand distribution of crude drugs and made positive recommendation for compila tion of an Ayurvedic \nPharmacopoeia. Thereafter, the Dave Committee (1955) reiterated t he recommendations for compilation of an \nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia. \n 7. The Government of Bombay, was specially interested in the surve y of resources of Ayurvedic Drugs, \ntheir collection, cultivation, farming, distribution and standardization. T hey, therefore had appointed a Committee \nfor Standard and Genuine Ayurvedic Herbs and Drugs in 1955 and subsequently af ter receiving its report with \nfresh set of terms of reference, appointed a second committee cal led the Committee for Standard Ayurvedic Herbs \nand Drugs in 1957 both under the Chairmanship of Vaidya Bapalal Shah, of which Professor A.N. Namjoshi was \nthe Member Secretary. The Bapalal Committee had very elabora tely recommended the compilation of the \nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia as an urgent prerequisite for effective control of Ayurvedic Drugs to ensure quality "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 16, "text": " XVI  assurance. Finally Government of India appointed the \u201cAyurvedic Resea rch Evaluation Committee\u201d, under the \nChairmanship of Dr. K.N. Udupa (1958) which had strongly highlighted the urgenc y of the compilation of an \nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia. \n 8. In compliance with some of these recommendations, the Union Government  as also some of the State \nGovernments had started taking positive steps. The Government of Bom bay State established its Board of Research \nin Ayurveda, Bombay in 1951, which was subsequently reconstituted in 1955 and 1958. The  Government of India \nestablished CCRIMH in 1969 for research in all aspects including drug  standardisation in Indian Medicine & \nHomoeopathy. This Council was divided into 4 research councils in 1978 and the research work in Ayurveda and \nSiddha was entrusted to the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda  & Siddha. The PLIM, at Ghaziabad was \nestablished in 1970 for testing and standardisation of single drugs and com pound formulations. Under the auspices \nof the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha, several survey units in different States were \nestablished and work of standardisation of single drugs and compound medici nes as also composite research work \nwas initiated. The first Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee was  constituted in 1962 under the Chairmanship of \nCol. Sir Ram Nath Chopra. The Committee was reconstituted in 1972 under the Chairmanship of Prof. A.N. \nNamjoshi which took over the work of compilation of the Ayurvedic Form ulary of India as a pre-requisite for \nunder taking the work of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. \n 9. After publication of the First and the Second part of the Ayurvedic  Formulary of India, Part-III of the \nFormulary is under preparation. A list of single drugs, which enter i nto the formulations, has been prepared.  \nCollection of data from published material and from experimental work  in collaborative laboratories to produce \nnecessary data is being done under the auspices of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Commi ttee. \n 10. The First and Second Part of the Ayurvedic Formulary of India com prising of some 444 and 191 \nformulations respectively cover more than 351 single drugs of plant or igin. This is part of about 500 priority drugs \nof plant origin to come within the ambit of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. \n 11. While systematic efforts are on to introduce quality control, ove r the ayurvedic drugs during the post-\nindependence period, it is interesting to note that the great strides  made by the western or modern system of \nmedicine, with its formidable armoury of synthetic drugs, chemo-thera peutic agents and antibiotics, are slowing \ndown gradually with the realization of their adverse effects ca using damage to the human systems. The western \nworld is coming to accept the value of herbal medicines, appreciate  and understand the basic philosophy of \nAyurveda, which initially appeared to be rather abstract and diffic ult to interpret in terms of modern medical \nsciences. \n 12. With the introduction of legislative measures for quality control , a process initiated some 50 years ago, \nthere would be some uniformity in the Ayurvedic medicines marketed, in so far as their identity, purity and \nstrength are concerned. The physician and the patient would be assured of the quality of the medicine through \nproper drug control measures. The efforts to publish an Ayurvedic Formula ry of India and to compile the \nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India intend to serve the profession and the public through proper qua lity assurance. \n 13. The Union Government have brought the Ayurvedic Drugs under the purview  of the Drugs and \nCosmetic Act 1940 from 15-9-1964. The publication of the Ayurvedic Formulary  of India and the Ayurvedic \nPharmacopoeia of India strengthens the Government in the enforcement of the Act in res pect of standards. \n 14. The State Government found it difficult to implement the requirem ents of the Act, in so far as the \nanalytical quality control was concerned, although they had already im plemented the administrative requirements, \nsuch as manufacturing licenses, qualification of staff, suitability  of premises, equipment etc., The fledgling \nayurvedic industry could have its own \u2018in-house\u2019 standards, as indeed som e had, but it was necessary to subject \ntheir products to the vigilance of the Regulatory body. \n 15. In view of the need of the hour to implement the Drugs and Cosmeti cs Act, the Ayurvedic \nPharmacopoeia Committee has made a modest effort to lay down standa rds for single drugs relying on \nexperimental data worked out from scratch at the PLIM, Ghaziabad a nd some of the units of the Central Council \nfor Research in Ayurveda and Siddha. Absence of  published scientific l iterature on the subject hampered their \nwork, and delay was inevitable  \n 16. The Western countries did pass through this phase about 150 years ago a nd took up the task of \npreparation for a pharmacopoeia. Endeavor by universities and manufactur es in Britain and other European \ncountries resulted in scientific data for drafting the pharmacopoeia l monographs for single drugs.  Thus, scientific "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 17, "text": " XVII  data was available for compilation of the modern pharmacopoeia, but for compilation of the Ayurvedic \nPharmacopoeia little information and published data exists and the Ayurv edic Pharmacopoeia Committee had to \ninitiate basic research. \n 17. It is worthwhile noting that the principle of quality control for m edicines were well known to the \nAyurvedic physicians and indeed followed by them in their practice.  T his is evident from the classical Sanskrt \ntexts, where elaborate instructions are set down with great visi on, in an astonishingly rational and scholarly \nmanner, suitable to the conditions then prevalent. The description of Era nda and Guduci in Bhavaprakasa bear \nwitness to this.   Modern methods of analysis advocated in the present  Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia for identity and \npurity have benefited greatly from the original texts.  What moder n medicine has achieved is an explanation of the \nprinciples of quality control with greater precision, backing them w ith experimental evidence to bring about their \nuniversal acceptance.   \n 18. The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India Part\u2013I , Vol-I, II, III, IV and V comprises 80, 78, 100, 68 and \n92 monographs of Ayurvedic single drugs of plant origin, which go into one or more formulations included in the \nAyurvedic Formulary of India Part-I and Part-II. In compiling the monographs, the title of each drug has been \ngiven in Sanskrit as present in the Ayurvedic Formularies of Indi a. This is followed by a definition of the drug \ngiving its identity in scientific nomenclature and a very brief  information about its source, occurrence, distribution \nand precautions in collection if any, etc.  This is followed by a lis t of synonyms in Sanskrit and also in the other \nIndian regional languages. The monographs then record detailed Macroscopic  and Microscopic description of the \ndrug having pharmacognostic value in identification, especially when the drug is in pow der form.  This volume has \nalso included monographs on certain products like ghee, potable water, produc ts of Saccharum officinarum L. like \nsharkara, jaggery and also natural  product like honey. Apart from this, the monog raphs on exotic but domesticated \nplants which are in routine uses are also included, like Eucalyptus oil and Peppermint  satva (Menthol).  Along with \n93 single drugs of plant origin, this volume also includes certain other  drug substances like animal products, \nprocessed or extracted materials, and major adjuvant, vehicles etc., tha t appear in formulations either as ingredients \nor as processing adjuvant.  \n19. The monograph then gives chemical norms and limits under \u201cIdentity, P urity and Strength\u201d like \ntolerance for foreign matter, total ash, acid insoluble ash, alcohol s oluble extractive, water soluble extractive, \nvolatile oil contents etc. Some of them have a direct bearing on t he purity and strength, while others aid in \ndetecting substitution or adulteration, if any. Where possible and known, Assay of an act ive constituent or group of \nconstituents like total alkaloids or total volatile oils have been given. However, under the heading \u2018Constituents\u2019 \none or more constituents or group of constituents like oleoresins, essent ial oils, alkaloids have been mentioned \nwhich only have an informative value based on published research work i n phytochemistry.  In all the proximate \nanalytical values set for ash and extractives, only a maximum or  minimum value for limit has been attempted.  It is \nworth mentioning that there is always a wide variation in analyt ical results among crude drugs of plant origin in \nrespect of their chemical contents, due to varied climatic conditi ons, geographical distribution, source and season \nof collection and differing methods of storage and preservation. Therefore, variati on in results of chemical analysis \ncreate a great difficulty in fixing a narrow range of limits  for single drugs. However, the data has been fixed on the \nbasis of results from as many samples as possible, procured from different sources . \n 20. In each of the monographs, classical attributes of respective dr ugs according to the doctrine of Rasa, \nGuna, Virya, Vipaka and Karma have been kept intact.  They may appe ar abstract and unsupported by established \nexperimental methods to define them, but are considered a reasonable bas is and convenient reference point for a \nclinical classification.  However, since they cannot be validate d by modern scientific methods, they are not \nmandatory. \n 21. The Legal Notices and General Notices have been given for the  attention of the Pharmaceutical \nsuppliers and regulatory authorities. Details about the apparatus, rea gents and solutions, tests, methods of \npreparation of specimens for microscopical examinations have been given in Appendices . \n 22. The Committee hopes that the publication of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoe ia of India Part I, Vol. VI \ncomprising of 93 single drugs of vegetables origin would add to the requi rements under the Drugs and Cosmetics \nAct.  The regular monitoring of the manufactured and marketed ayurv edic drugs, on the basis of the standards \nprescribed therein would bear evidence of the usefulness of these volum es and help enhance their quality and status \nin revisions for the future.

Though Ayurveda has undergone many changes in the cours e of its long history, it still \nremains the mainstay of medical relief to a large section of  the population of the nation. Due to urbanisaton and \ndwindling of forests, the Vaidya was no longer self sufficient in c ollecting and preparing his own medicines as \nbefore.  He had come to depend on outside agencies for collecting and supply ing the crude drugs be required. \nOthers undertaking mass production of medicines in Ayurvedic Pharmaci es on commercial scale, took over the \nrole of the Vaidya - Pharmacist also.  \n \n 2. In view of the such trend in the Ayurvedic field Govt. of India cons idered it expedient to extend the \nDrugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, to the Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani drugs to a limited measure.  \n \n3. The Act was accordingly amended in 1964, to ensure only a limited control over the produc tion and sale \nof these medicines namely:- \n \ni. The manufacture should be carried under prescribed hygienic conditions , under the supervision of \na person having  prescribed qualifications; \n \nii. The raw materials used in the preparation of drugs should be genuine and properly identi fied; and  \n \niii. The formula or the true list of all the ingredients containe d in the drugs should be displayed on the \nlabel of every container. \n \n4. To start with, development of standards for the identity, purity and s trength of single drugs and \nformulations at a later stage, assumed importance for the effec tive enforcement of the provision of the Act. If the \nraw materials to be used in a medicine and stage-by-stage proce sses of manufacturers were standardised, the final \nproduct namely, the compound formulation could be expected to conform to uniform st andards. The requirements \nthat the list of ingredients be displayed on the label will enable analysts in important cases to verify label claims \nand to that extent will bind the manufacture to a true claim. Arrang ements to evolve and lay down physical, \nchemical and biological tests, wherever necessary, to identify t he drugs and ascertain their quality and to detect \nadulterations are an urgent necessity of the profession. Setting up of Drug St andardisation Units, Research Centres, \nDrug Testing Institutes and Central Drug Laboratories for Ayurve dic Medicines both at the All-India and Regional \nlevels for this purpose are therefore, essential. The several C ommittees appointed by the Government of India to \nassess and evaluate the status and practice of Ayurvedic Medici ne have stressed the importance of preparing an \nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia. \n \n5. Having regard to all these considerations, the Central Council of Ayurvedic Research recommended the \nconstitution of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee consisting of expert s on Ayurveda and other sciences. The \nGovernment of India accepted the recommendations of the Central Council  of Ayurvedic Research and constituted \nthe First Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee, vide their letter  No. 14-8/62-ISM, dated the 20 th September, 1962 \nfor a period of three years with effect from the date of its f irst meeting under the Chairmanship of Col.

Microscopic identification tests ar e confined to those formulations where \nthe botanical ingredients are not more than ten , and where they are added \u2018in situ\u2019  in powder form as \u2018 Praksepa \nDravy \u00a2s\u2019 . Such comminuted ingredients lend themselves for microscopic identifi cation, as they are not drastically \nchanged in cell structure or contents while processing, and appear inta ct in microscopic slide preparations, after \nproper treatment. \n \n Appropriate processing for separation and isolation of botanical debris from a formulation without loss of \ndebris, by hand picking, shifting, washing, sedimentation, density separati on or by floatation etc., are the \npreliminary steps. This is followed by clearing the debris in chem ical reagents, reacting it with suitable reagents \nand stains and finally mounting a little part on a slide in a medium  of suitable refractive index (see later part) that \nhelps to show the unit structures in good relief.  Identification of the  discrete, but disoriented units from the \nbotanical ingredients in a formulation will not be possible without proper isolation, and should not  be attempted. \n \n Monographs where the test is prescribed give both a relevant met hod of isolation and diagnostic features \nspecific to the expected ingredients in that formulation.  Only a bri ef method and a few of the characteristics for \neach ingredient are given, but an analyst may use other methods of i solation and choose more characteristics to \ndraw a correct conclusion. \n \n Although monographs prescribe standards only for the \u2018 Praksepa Dravyas\u2019, characteristics from other \ningredients that are processed into extracts or decoctions prior to t heir addition to a formulation may also be seen in \na slide preparation, giving rise to recognisable unique characteris tics. In addition, cell or tissue structures common \nto several ingredients added to a formulation, and therefore not specif ic to any one of them, would also be present. \nCaution should therefore be exercised so that such features are not cons trued as parts from adulterants or \nsubstitutes or foreign parts.  Proper study of the individual ingredient s using authentic material and reference to \ntheir monographs in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia for Single Drugs would help avoid errors of this nature.  Skill in \nthe recognition of discrete and disoriented tissue components and the knowl edge required to ascribe them to their \ncorrect source should be acquired by the analyst. \n \nStains and Reagents for Microchemical Reactions  \n  \nThe Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia volumes on single drugs already include m icrochemical reactions for ergastic \nsubstances and may be consulted in addition to the following for use on isolated debris: \n \nAcetic acid:  Dilute 6 ml of glacial acetic acid with 100 ml of distilled w ater; used for identification of cystoliths, \nwhich dissolve with effervescence. \n \nAniline chloride solution:  Dissolve 2 g in a mixture of 65 ml of 30 per cent ethyl alcohol and 15 ml dist illed water \nand add 2 ml of conc.

Crush the \nmaterial with scalpel and cover with cover slip before examining. \n \n(ii) Cut materials  \u2013 For examining cut leaves, herbs and flowers, take several piec es in a test tube and \nemploy the same methods as described for entire materials. \n \nOther methods employed for clarification of the material (leaf and stem) are  described below :- \n \n(a) Leaf  \u2013 Boil pieces of leaves in a test tube with chloral hydrate for  several minutes until completely \nclarified and then examine them in chloral hydrate solution. After cl arification, leaf pieces are divided into two \nparts with the help of a scalpel or needle, and carefully turn one par t. The leaf can be examined from both the \ndorsal and ventral surfaces. \n \n(b) Stem  \u2013 To examine stem material (without leaf) boil pieces in a sol ution of caustic alkali or in nitric \nacid. Remove the epidermis with a scalpel or a needle for examini ng the surface. For examining pressed specimen \nof stem, take separate tissue and press them with a scalpel on the slide. \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 272, "text": " CCLXXII  B.

FRUITS AND SEEDS \n \nA. Entire materials \n \nFor microscopical examination of fruit and seed take the specimens or outer coat of seed or fruit \nand examine as described below : \n \n(i) Outer Coat  \u2013 For examining the outer coat boil 3 or 4 seeds or fruits in caustic  alkali solution in a test \ntube for 1-2 minutes (outer coat specimens with intensive pigmentation are boiled f or longer period). After boiling, \nplace the pieces on slide, remove the layers of the coat and examine them after mounti ng in glycerol solution. \n \n(ii) Section  \u2013 If fruits or seeds are too hard to cut then boil them for 15-30 minute s or more depending on \ntheir hardness or keep them in moistening chamber or absorb in water and chloroform solution or soften them with \nstem and then cut the specimen for examining purpose. For cutting small , flat seeds (which are difficult to hold) \nplace them in a pith or potato slit for section cutting. Small, round or smooth seeds cannot be cut  into section in the \npith, then in such cases, they may be embedded in paraffin wax blocks for  section cutting. For this, a block of \nparaffin (0.6 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 1.5 cms. in size) is made and the seed is embedded in the block by making a cavity or a pit in \nthe block with a hot teasing needle. Cut the section with a sharp ra zor (through the object) together with the \nparaffin, place them on to the slide, remove paraffin with a needle or wash it with xylene and examine the section \nin chloral-hydrate solution. \n \nB.

Starch  \u2013 For examining the presence of starch in the seed, take two speci mens, one in iodine solution and the \nother in water. With iodine solution starch turns blue. Shape and the struc ture of starch grains can be seen in water \nand their size is measured. \n \n When examining objects containing starch, prepare specimen by slightl y warming in chloral-hydrate \nsolution. \n \n2. Fixed Oil  \u2013 For examining the presence of fixed oil, prepare a specimen in a s olution of Sudan III droplets of \nfixed oil are coloured orange pink. When examining objects containing smal l amount of fixed oil, prepare a \nspecimen by slightly warming in chloral-hydrate solution, and when exam ining objects containing large amount of \nfixed oil, then the powder is de-fatted and clarified as follows: \n \nPlace 0.5 g. of the powder in a porcelain dish, add 5-10 ml. of dilute nitric acid \nand boil for 1 minute, then strain off the liquid through a cloth, wash the r esidue with hot water and return it to the \nporcelain dish with a spatula, boil it with 5-10 ml of caustic alka li solution for 1 minute and again strain it through \nthe cloth and wash with water. Examine the residue in a glycerol s olution, after the treatment the structure of the \nlayers of the coat and their cells can be seen very distinctly. \n \n3.

The vein-islet number has proved \nuseful for the critical distinction of certain nearly related species.

Move the paper so that the square is \nseen in the centre of the field of the eyepiece. Place the slide  with the cleared leaf piece on the microscope stage \nand draw in the veins and veinlets included within the square, completing  the outlines of those vein-islets which \noverlap two adjacent sides of the square. Count the number of vein-isl ets within the square including those \noverlapping on two adjacent sides and excluding those intersected by the other two sides . The result obtained is the \nnumber of vein-islets in 4 square millimeters. For each sample of  leaf make not fewer than three determinations \nand calculate the average number of vein-islets per square millimeter. \n \nFor Leaf Fragments having an area less than 4 square millimeters  \u2013 Take fragments of leaf lamina each with \nan area of not less than 1 square millimeter, excluding the midrib a nd the margin of the leaf.

This solution, referred to as the ` test solution\u2019, is used in the actual test. \n \nGeneral Test - The glass tube is lightly packed with cotton wool, previously moiste ned with lead acetate solution \nand dried, so that the upper surface of the cotton wool is not less than 25 mm below the top of the tube. The upper \nend of the tube is then inserted into the narrow end of one of the pair of r ubber bungs, either to a depth of about 10 \nmm when the tube has a rounded-off end, or so that the ground end of the tube i s flush with the larger end of the \nbung.

The assay of the element being examined is tested by dete rmining the decreased degree of light intensity of \nradiation. Atomic absorption obeys the general rule for absorption spectr ophotometry. The assay is carried out by \ncomparing the abosorbance of the test preparation with that of the reference preparat ion.  \n \nApparatus \n \nAn atomic absorption spectrophotometer consists of a light source, an at omic generator, a monochromator \nand a detector system. Some are equipped with a background compensation s ystem and automatic sampling \nsystem, etc. \n \n \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 296, "text": " CCXCVI  1. Light Source: A hollow-cathode discharge lamp is usually used. The cathode is made of  the element being \nexamined. \n \n2. Atomic Generator: There are four main types : flame atomizer, graphite furnace a tomizer, hydride-generated \natomizer, cold vapor atomizer. \n \n(1) Flame atomizer:  It mainly consists of a nebulizer and a burner. Its function is to ne bulize the test solution into \naerosol, which is mixed with combustion gas. And the mixture is introduced into the flame generated by the burner. \nSo that the substance being examined is to be dried, evaporated to form t he ground state atoms of the element being \nexamined. The burning flame is generated by different mixtures of ga ses, acetylene-air is mostly used. By \nmodifying the proportion of combustion gas, the temperature of the flame can be controlled and a better stability \nand a better sensitivity can be obtained. \n \n(2) Furnace atomizer: It consists of electric furnace and a power supply. Its function is to dry and incinerate the \nsubstance being examined. During the stage of high temperature atomization, the g round state atoms of the element \nbeing examined are to be formed. Graphite is commonly used as the heat er. Protection gas is introduced into the \nfurnace to avoid oxidation and used to transfer the sample vapor. \n \n(3) Hydride-generated atomizer:  It consists of hydride generator and atomic absorption cell. It is used for the \ndetermination of the elements such as arsenic, selenium and antimony etc. Its function is to reduce the element to \nbe examined in acidic medium to the low-boiling and easily pyrolyzed hy dride. The hydride is then swept by a \nstream of carrier gas into the atomic absorption cell which consi sts of quartz tube and heater etc., in which the \nhydride is pyrolyzed by heating to form the ground-state atom. \n \n(4) Cold vapor atomizer:  It consists of a mercury vapor atomizer and an absorption cell. It  is suitable for the \ndetermination of mercury. Its function is to reduce the mercuric ion into mercury vapor which is swept into the \nquartz absorption cell by carrier gas. \n \n3. Monochromator: Its function is to separate the specified wavelength radiation fr om the electromagnetic \nradiations erradiated from the light source. The optical path of the apparatus should assure the good spectra \nresolution and has the ability to work well at the condition of narrow spectral band (0.2 nm). The commonly used \nwavelength region is 190.0 - 900.0 nm. \n \n4. Detector system: It consists of a detector, a signal processor and a recording syst em. It should have relatively \nhigher sensitivity and better stability and can follow the rapid change of the signa l absorption. \n \n5. Background compensation system: System employed for the correction of atmospheric effects on the \nmeasuring system. Four principles can be utilized for background compens ation: continuous spectrum sources (a \ndeuterium lamp is often used in the UV region), the Zeeman effect, the self inversion phenomenon and the non \nresonance spectrum. In the analysis using atomic absorption spectrophotome try, the interference to the \ndetermination caused by background and other reasons should be noticed. Changes of some experimental \nconditions, such as the wavelength, the slit width, the atomizing conditi on, etc., may affect the sensitivity, the \nstability and the interference. If it is flame, the suitable w avelength, slit width and flame temperature, the addition \nof complexing agents and releasing agents and the use of Standard addit ion method may eliminate interference. If \nit is furnace, system, the selection of suitable background compensat ion system and the addition of suitable matrix \nmodifying agents, etc may remove the interference.

The term \n\u2018growth\u2019 is used to designate the presence and presumed proliferation of viable micr o-organisms. \n \nPreliminary Testing  \n \nThe methods given herein are invalid unless it is demonstrated that  the test specimens to which they are \napplied do not, of themselves, inhibit the multiplication under the test c onditions of micro-organisms that can be \npresent. Therefore, prior to doing the tests, inoculate diluted specimens  of the substance being examined with \nseparate viable cultures of Escherichia coli , Salmonella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Staphylococcus \naureus . This is done by adding 1 ml of not less than 10 -3 dilutions of a 24 h broth culture of the micro-organisms to \nthe first dilution (in buffer solution pH 7.2, fluid soyabean-casein diges t medium or fluid lactose medium) of the \ntest material and following the test procedure. If the organisms fail to grow in the relevant medium the procedure \nshould be modified by (a) increasing the volume of diluent with the quantity of tes t material remaining the same, or \n(b) incorporating a sufficient quantity of a suitable inactivating agent in the diluents, or (c) combining the \naforementioned modifications so as to permit growth of the organisms in the media. If inhibitory substances are \npresent in the sample, 0.5 per cent of soya lecithin and 4 per cent of pol ysorbate 20 may be added to the culture \nmedium. Alternatively, repeat the test as described in the previ ous paragraph, using fluid casein digest-soya \nlecithin-polysorbate 20 medium to demonstrate neutralization of preserv atives or other antimicrobial agents in the \ntest material. Where inhibitory substances are contained in the produc t and the latter is soluble, the Membrane \nfiltration method described under Total Aerobic Microbial Count may be used. \n \nIf in spite of incorporation of suitable inactivating agents and a s ubstantial increase in the volume of \ndiluent it is still not possible to recover the viable cultures de scribed above and where the article is not suitable for \napplying the membrane filtration method it can be assumed that the f ailure to isolate the inoculated organism may \nbe due to the bactericidal activity of the product. This may indicat e that the article is not likely to be contaminated \nwith the given species of micro-organisms. However, monitoring shoul d be continued to establish the spectrum of \ninhibition and bactericidal activity of the article. \n  \nMedia  \n \nCulture media may be prepared as given below or dehydrated culture me dia may be used provided \nthat, when reconstituted as directed by the manufacturer, they have si milar ingredients and / or yield \nmedia comparable to those obtained from the formulae given below. \n \nWhere agar is specified in a formula, use agar that has a mois ture content of not more than 15 per cent. \nWhere water is called for in a formula, use purified water.

It is applicable  to substances or their derivatives, which are \nvolatilized under the temperatures employed. \n \nGC is based on mechanisms of adsorption, mass distribution or size exclusion. \n \nApparatus \n \nThe apparatus consists of an injector, a chromatographic column contained in an oven, a detector and a \ndata acquisition system (or an integrator or a chart recorder). T he carrier gas flows through the column at a \ncontrolled rate or pressure and then through the detector. \n \nThe chromatography is carried out either at a constant temperature  or according to a given temperature \nprogramme. \n \nInjectors \nDirect injections  of solutions are the usual mode of injection, unless otherwise prescribe d in the \nmonograph. Injection may be carried out either directly at the head of  the column using a syringe or an injection \nvalve, or into a vaporization chamber which may be equipped with a stream splitter. \n \nInjections of vapour phase  may be effected by static or dynamic head-space injection systems. \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 321, "text": " CCCXXI  Dynamic head-space  (purge and trap) injection systems include a sparging device by whi ch volatile \nsubstances in solution are swept into an absorbent column maintained at a  low temperature. Retained substances \nare then desorbed into the mobile phase by rapid heating of the absorbent column. \n \nStatic head-space  injection systems include a thermostatically controlled sample he ating chamber in which \nclosed vials containing solid or liquid samples are placed for a fi xed period of time to allow the volatile \ncomponents of the sample to reach equilibrium between the non-gaseous phas e and the vapour phase. After \nequilibrium has been established, a predetermined amount of the head-spac e of the vial is flushed into the gas \nchromatograph. \n \nStationary Phases \n \nStationary phases are contained in columns, which may be: \n \n- a capillary column of fused-silica close wall is coated with the stationary pha se. \n- a column packed with inert particles impregnated with the stationary phase. \n- a column packed with solid stationary phase.  \n \nCapillary columns are 0.1 mm to 0.53 mm in internal diameter ( \u0424) and 5 to 6 m in length.  The liquid or \nstationary phase, which may be chemically bonded to the inner surface, is a film 0.1 \u00b5m to 5.0 \u00b5 m thick. \n \nPacked columns, made of glass or metal, are usually 1 m to 3 m in length with an internal diameter ( \u0424) of \n2 mm to 4 mm. Stationary phases usually consist of porous polymers or s olid supports impregnated with liquid \nphase. \n \nSupports for analysis of polar compounds on columns packed with low-capacity , low-polarity stationary \nphase must be inert to avoid peak tailing. The reactivity of support  materials can be reduced by silanising prior to \ncoating with liquid phase. Acid-washed, flux-calcinated diatomaceous ea rth is often used. Materials are available in \nvarious particle sizes, the most commonly used particles are in the ranges of 150 \u00b5m to 180 \u00b5m and 125 \u00b5m to 150 \n\u00b5m.   \n \nMobile Phases \n \nRetention time and peak efficiency depend on the carrier gas flow rate; retention time is directly \nproportional to column length and resolution is proportional to the square root of the column length. For packed \ncolumns, the carrier gas flow rate is usually expressed in mill iliters per minute at atmospheric pressure and room \ntemperature, flow rate is measured at the detector outlet, eithe r with a calibrated mechanical device or with a \nbubble tube, while the column is at operating temperature. The linear v elocity of the carrier gas through a packed \ncolumn is inversely proportional to the square root of the internal diam eter of the column for a given flow volume. \nFlow rates of 60 ml/min in a 4 mm internal diameter column and 15 ml /min in a 2 mm internal diameter column, \ngive identical linear velocities and thus similar retention times. \n \nHelium or nitrogen is usually employed as the carrier gas for pa cked columns, whereas commonly used \ncarrier gases for capillary columns are nitrogen, helium and hydrogen. \nDetectors \n \nFlame-ionisation detectors are usually employed but additional detect ors which may be used include: \nelectron-capture, nitrogen-phosphorus, mass spectrometric, thermal conducti vity, Fourier transform infrared \nspectrophotometric and others, depending on the purpose of the analysis. \n \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 322, "text": " CCCXXII  Method \n \nEquilibrate the column, the injector and the detector at the temperat ures and the gas flow rates specified in \nthe monograph until a stable baseline is achieved.

PHYSICAL TESTS AND DETERMINATIONS \n \n3.1.1. - REFRACTIVE INDEX  \n \n The refractive index ( \u03b7) of a substance with reference to air is the ratio of the sine of the ang le of incidence \nto the sine of the angle of refraction of a beam of light passing from air into the substance. It varies with the \nwavelength of the light used in its measurement. \n \n Unless otherwise prescribed, the refractive index is measured a t 25 0 (\u00b10.5) with reference to the \nwavelength of the D line of sodium ( \u03bb 589.3 nm). The temperature should be carefully adjusted and maintained \nsince the refractive index varies significantly with temperature. \n \nThe Abbe\u2019s refractometer is convenient for most measurements of refractive index but other refractometer \nof equal or greater accuracy may be used. Commercial refractom eters are normally constructed for use with white \nlight but are calibrated to give the refractive index in terms of the D line of sodi um light. \n \nTo achieve accuracy, the apparatus should be calibrated against distilled water which has a refractive index \nof 1.3325 at 25 0 or against the reference liquids given in the Table 3.1. \n \nTable 3.1 \n_______________________________________________________________________  \n \nReference        \u03b7 D 20\u00ba              Temperature  \nLiquid                                               Co-efficient    \n                                            \u2206n/ \u2206t \n \nCarbon tetrachloride     1.4603   -0.00057 \nToluene      1.4969   -0.00056 \n\u03b1-Methylnaphthalene     1.6176   -0.00048 \n________________________________________________________________________ \n* Reference index value for the D line of sodium, measured at 20 0 \n \nThe cleanliness of the instrument should be checked frequently by deter mining the refractive index of \ndistilled water, which at 25 0 is 1.3325. \n \n3.1.2. - WEIGHT PER MILLILITRE AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY  \n \n    A.

Solution (1) contains 5.0 per \ncent v/v of ethanol and 5.0 per cent v/v of 1-propanol (internal standard). For solution (2) dilute a volume of the \npreparation being examined with water to contain between 4.0 and 6.0 per cent  v/v of ethanol. Prepare solution (3) \nin the same manner as solution (2) but adding sufficient of the interna l standard to produce a final concentration of \n5.0 per cent v/v. \n \nThe chromatographic procedure may be carried out using a column (1.5 m x 4 mm) packed with porous \npolymer beads (100 to 120 mesh) and maintained at 150 0, with both the inlet port and the detector at 170 0, and \nnitrogen as the carrier gas.  \n \nCalculate the percentage content of ethanol from the areas of the peaks due to ethanol  in the chromatogram \nobtained with solutions (1) and (3). \n \n \n \n \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 338, "text": " CCCXXXVIII  Method II \n \nFor preparations where the use of Industrial Methylated Spirit is permitted in the monograph, determine \nthe content of ethanol as described in Method I but using as solution (2) a  volume of the preparation being \nexamined diluted with water to contain between 4.0 and 6.0 per cent v/v of total ethanol and methano l. \n \nDetermine the concentration of methanol in the following manner.

Cool and \ndissolve the ash in purified water and make up to 100 ml in a volumetric flask.  \n \nSwitch on the instrument first and then the pump. Keep distilled water  for aspiration and allow it to stand \nfor 15 min (warming time). Open the glass cylinder and ignite the flame. Adjust the i nstrument to zero. \n \nIntroduce the maximum concentration solution and adjust it to 100. Again introduc e the purified water so \nthat instrument shows zero. Then introduce the standard solution in ascendi ng concentration. Note down the \nreading each time. Introduce the purified water for aspiration in bet ween the standard solutions. Introduce the \nsample solution and if it is within the range take the reading. If  it exceeds limit 100 then dilute the solution till the \nreading is within the range. Plot the curve with concentration in ppm against reading obtained. Find out the \nconcentration of the sample solution. Take two or three readings and fi nd out the average. Find out the \nconcentration of sodium and potassium. \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-6.pdf", "page_number": 383, "text": " CCCLXXXIII  5.2.10. - Determination of Sodium Chloride \n \nDissolve about 2-3g accurately weighed drug in 25 ml of purified  water  and left for 30 minutes, filter. \nWash the filter paper completely with purified  water  and the filtrate is made 100 ml in volumetric flask, make the \nsolution homogeneous, titrate 25 ml of this solution with 0.1 N silver nitrate solution  using potassium chromate  as \nindicator.

In addition, they also include the features of a monograph that are mandatory standards.  \n Title: The title of this book is \"Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, Part-I, Vol.VII  (Minerals \nand Metals)\". Monographs on twenty -one raw drugs (minerals  / metals  / ores) are included in \nthis volume.  \n Monograph : Each Monograph carries prescribed mandatory standards and general \ninformation, including those from Ayurvedic  Classics. The Monographs are arranged in the \nEnglish alphabetical order, based on the main Samsk\u0157ta official name.  \n Monograph Title : The title given on top of each monograph indicates the name of the  \nmaterial  in Samsk\u0157ta , and is the same as mentioned in the single drugs list on the Ayurvedic \nFormularies for Minerals, Metal s and Ores. It is the \" Official Name \" along with synonyms in \nSamsk\u0157ta . This is followed by a scientific nomenclature in English that is nearest and most \nappropriate to the article described, and is also \" Official\".  \n Synonyms : Taking into account the multilingual nature of the country, other names of the \ndrug have been listed in Indian languages other than Samsk\u0157ta  as far as these are available. \nThe Urdu and Tamil equivalents, however, are those appearing for the same drug  in their \nrespective Formularies.  \n Broad Classification: The raw materials obtained from the earth's crust and used in the indigenous systems of medicines are of great complexity, being a mixture of various elements, compounds and gangue  (waste rock i.e. the non- metalliferous part of an ore, not \nuseful for the i ntended purpose). They may be chemically classified only in a broad sense, and \nexact chemical nomenclature cannot be assigned. Therefore, a broad classification, such as Silicate, Sulphide, Oxide and Metal etc. , is added for  basic information.  \n    \nOrigin and occurrence: The nature and forms in which a raw drug occurs in the earth's  crust \nand its association with other minerals and rocks are included to give an idea about geology of the substance. The occurrence and availability of the article in India are  also incorporated . \nThis important information reflects the commercial potential of the article as a source for the drug required by the Ayurvedic, Siddha & Unani practitioners, and to the manufacturers.  \n \nStandards:  For mandatory purposes, the statements m ade under the following headings in a \nmonograph shall constitute \" Official Standards \", ........Title, Definition, Identification \n(Physical, Optical and Chemical properties), Tests and Assays, Distinction from substitutes and adulterants, Heavy metals, and t he \"\u015aodhana\" process described and recommended in \nclassics quoted in Appendix - 5.

These are reli able and easy \nidentification features for minerals and metals. Fluorescence and XRD analysis applied for \nidentification of a few articles have also been included. Physical properties serve as the preliminary but powerful parameters for identification of ra w drugs. Definitions of geological \nterminology used in the monographs and methods of determination of various parameters are given in Appendix -1.  \n Optical Properties: These include the application of optical crystallography in identification of minerals that are crystalline and transparent, irrespective of their chemical composition.  \nThis is a time -tested petrographic/ mineralogical method of analysis using thin sections of \nmineral or ore samples, but adapted and applied to powdered materials to suit pharm acopoeial \nrequirement. Several parameters can be computed from only a few fragments using immersion liquids of known Refractive Indices, by a method known as the 'Immersion Method' . Description of the principle and the method of determination of various constants \nare given in detail in Appendix -2.  \n Chemical Properties:  Under this, confirmatory ide ntification tests for raw drugs  are \nmentioned. These include charcoal test, flame colouration test, effect of heat, solubility in water and acids and reaction wit h different acids. The most important, however, are \ndetermination of assays for major ingredients and minor constituents, presence of heavy metals and other elements of significance.

The \nuse of a few mineral s and metals in Ayur vedic med icines  is since Vedic period but scientific \nand systematic stud ies were conducted from  8th century onwards forming an integral part of \nAyur vedic med icines  called Rasa\u015b \u0101stra  and the formulations called Rasyogas .                 \n  \nThe brief history of Rasa\u015b\u0101stra  reveals many aspects of this science when viewed in \nperspe ctives of identification, \u015aodhana (Purification), M\u0101ra\u00b4a (Calcination), indic ations and \ndietetic regimen.  \n \nCaraka has used \u2018Rasa\u2019  in Kustha cikits \u0101 but it is not sure whether it is P\u0101rada or else. Six \nmetals viz. Svar \u00b4a, Rajata, T \u0101mra, Loha, Va \u00acga and N \u0101ga have been coined under drugs of \nmineral origin. These metals have been indicated for preparation of different devices like \nBastinetra, Dh\u016bmanetra, etc. Specialized proce dures like Loh\u0101di Ras \u0101yana, Ayask \u00a8ti have \nbeen described so that these metals can be converted into a consumable and efficacious \ndosage form for ther apeutic use. For this, the thin sheets of metals are repeatedly heated and \nquenched in a series of li quids viz. Triphal \u0101 kv\u0101 tha, Gom \u016btra, Godugdha, Lava \u00b4ajala, etc. \nuntil conversion to fine powder. Apart from metals, various other minerals like Gandhaka, \nSvar\u00b4am\u0101ksika, Har it\u0101la, Mana \u00aa\u015bil\u0101, Ma \u00b4\u00b2\u016bra, Gairika, etc.; al loys viz. K \u0101\u00bcsya, Pitta la and \ngems viz. Mukt \u0101, Prav \u0101la have been mentioned for therapeutic and other uses. S u\u015bruta, in \naddition to all this, has used P \u0101rada (first non -ambiguous reference) tropi cally.  \n \nA\u00be\u00b0\u0101\u00acgasa\u00acgraha, for the first time, clearly indicates administration of P \u0101rada for its \nRas\u0101yana effect. Blowing up metal in a crucible to convert into pow der form has also been \ndescri bed by him.  \n \nAlmost of the marked developments of Rasa \u015b\u0101stra have taken place in this period (from 8th \ncentury A. D.). The science attended its peak of advancements and opened new horizons in the field of medicine. Several Rasasiddhas  (disciples of T \u0101ntrik a doctrine) have contributed \nto this process. The outcomes of their extensive exper imentations have been documented in \nthe form of texts. N \u0101g\u0101rjuna was the most si gnificant contributor to establish the aims, \nprinciples and methodologies of Rasa \u015b\u0101stra in an  organized and systematic manner. \nNumerous texts viz. Rasaratn\u0101kara, Rasendrama\n\u00acgala, Ras \u0101r\u00b4ava have been composed in \nthis period explaining \u015ao dhana, M \u0101rana, properties, therapeutic uses, dose specifications and \nvarious formul ations of Rasau\u00be adhis. The \u015aodhana and M\u0101ra\u00b4a methods may either be \ncharacter istic for some specific material or applicable to a group/category.

Though Ayurveda has under gone many changes in \nthe course of its long history, it still remains the mainstay of medical relief to a large section  \nof population of the nation. Due to urbanization and dwindling of forests, the Vaidya by and \nlarge is no longer a self contained unit collecting and preparing his own medicines as before. He has now to depend on the newly developed agencies like one colle cting and supplying the \ncrude drugs and the other undertaking mass production of medicines in the Ayurvedic Pharmaceutical units run on commercial scale.  \n \n2. In view of the new trend in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutical field, Government of India \nconsidered it expe dient to utilize  the existing Drug and Cosmetics Act 1940, to also control to \na limited measure the Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani drugs by amending the Act. \n \n3. The Act was accordingly amended in 1964, to ensure only a limited control over the \nproduction and sale of these medicines namely: - \n \ni. The manufacture should be carried under prescribed hygienic conditions, under supervision of a person having a prescribed qualification;  \n ii. The raw materials used in the preparation of dr ugs should be genuine and \nproperly i dentified; and  \n \niii.

Apart from a major s hare from medicinal plants, both animal \nproducts and geochemical s are in trade as well as in use by practitioners. The Formularies till \nnow published by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India , lists about 65 \nsubstances of Minerals/Metals /Ores as raw materials for use either as single drugs or added to \ncompound formulations. Such a list was prepared from classical medical literature in \n\u00a1yurveda, by eminent vaidyas and practicing  \u00a1yurvedic pharmacists who were members of \nthe earlier \u00a1 yurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committees in the seventies of last century. The list was \nfinalized after extensive tours, on- the-spot examinations and consultations with practitioners \nand user -pharmacies throughout the country. They also, for the first time, equated the  \nrecorded names of single drug in Sa \u00bcsk\u00a8t literature, with its modern scientific nomenclature, \nwith an eye to the future task of evolving quality standards for such raw drugs.  \n Methodology \n           The single drug list mentioned above formed the basis for present work. A general \nformat using appropriate geological descriptive titles was drafted by the APC. The format \nspecified the inputs required from the collaborating laboratories under various heads, so that a general description, analytical parameters for identification, their elemental composition, \nmethods of tests and assays and \u00a1 yurvedic uses etc., would be available for each of the drugs \nselected. The format was sent along with a preliminary note to the invitees of a Special Committee of Experts, co nstituted by the Ministry under the APC. The experts were from \nWadia Institute of Himalaya Geology, Dehradun, and also from \u00a1 yurvedic Research Institutes \nand Universities like Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi  and Gujarat \u00a1yurved \nUniversity (GAU), Jamnagar . An Annexure to this introduction gives the details of the \nsittings and decisions of this committee.  \n          As a sequel to the recommendation of this committee, further work was initiated by \nallotting a set of  47 Minerals/Metals/Ores to the Na tional Institute of \u00a1 yurveda (N.I.A.), \nJaipur  under the Director as the Principal Investigator and Shri J.K. Dhing , Former Chief \nManager (Exploration) , Hindustan Copper Ltd., Khetri Nagar and Dr. V.N. Rao, Associate \nProfessor , N.I.A ., Jaipur  as the Co -Investigators. Using both authentic and marketed samples, \nanalytical work was executed at the laboratories of the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), Ajmer  \nand Geological Survey of India (GSI), Jaipur , with Shri Dhing as the Co- ordinator. This \nvolume is based on the  results obtained from the above collaborating laboratories and on other \ninputs from Shri Dhing, Miss Satakopan and the \u00a1 yurvedic experts of the APC. It \nrecommends specifications and standards for 21 raw drugs and includes other relevant details.  \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 29, "text": " XXVIII  Structur e of this Volume  \n           A chapter on General Notices explains the rules and mechanisms that should be \nfollowed by analysts while applying the standards and tests in their work. There are various \nAppendices, detailing the methods of tests and assays, the reagents in use, and the equipments and apparatuses necessary. A special feature is a Glossary, to explain the geological terms used in describing the physical properties of the drugs. This is given to help analysts of pharmaceutical manufacturers and th e regulatory bodies who may not be familiar with the \nterminology used in identification of Minerals/Metals/Ores. On the \u0101yruvedic part of each \nmonograph, the ' \u00b9odhana', represents the purity measures as mandatory. Unlike plant or \nanimal products, there is no prior preparation of a mineral drug for the market, by any physical or chemical means. Purity for an \u0101 yurvedic Mineral/Metal/Ore does not imply the \nsame as it does for other drugs and does not deal with extraneous or introduced matter. While identity an d strength are dealt with by physical and chemical modern tests, the purity \nrequirement of a pharmacopoeial mineral/metal based drug is determined by \u00a1 yurvedic \nprocess described as ' \u00b9odhana'. Original \u00ba lokas dealing with ' \u00b9odhana' are included \nin Appendix -5. Hopefully, this would curtail the shortcuts now believed to be in use, by side -\nstepping the tedious ' \u00b9odhana' required and also discourages adverse comments that undesired \ntoxic remains are present in such \u00a1 yruvedic preparations.  \n          A preface (\nizLrkouk ) written  in Hindi by Dr. B.L. Gaur, currently Vice -\nChancellor,  Rajasthan \u00a1yurved University, Jodhpur (Rajasthan), and a member of the APC, is \nanother feature of departure from routine editorial structure followed for pharmacopoeia. It is necessary to explain the logic behind the use of substances known to be toxic, in medicines \nfor human use, place it in a correct perspective from the A yurvedic point of view and counter \nany misinterpretation. The inclusion of geochemicals in the treatment of human diseases by \ntraditional method in A yurveda should be justifiable. Hence , this special effort.  \n Scope and Limitations  \n           A pharmacopoeia emerges out of the common interests of stake holders. Its ultimate \npurpose is to aid the implementation of the re quirements under a legislation, which ensures \nsupply of quality drugs to a nation, and also monitors the activities of those responsible for \nthis. The core of objectives for a pharmacopoeia lies in the prescription of quality standards. Such standards should be scientifically sound, technologically attainable (by a small, medium and large scale industry equally), economically viable (for both industry and the common man in relation to the marketed product) and finally, culturally and conceptually compatible  to the \ntenets of the A yurvedic systems of treatment. These are basic to a well worked out \npharmacopoeia for traditional medicines.  \n          Constraints and compromises are inevitable in a pharmacopoeia for traditional \nmedicines, considering that empiric al wisdom, accumulated over a few thousand years by a \nhighly evolved society in ancient India, is sought to be shackled in a framework of requirements for the 21st century, in an effort to 'modernize' and keep up a global "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 30, "text": " XXIX  participation. In addition, this i s attempted in a scientific environment of huge knowledge \ngaps, owing to absence of research by modern scientists. Although the metal/mineral drugs \nhave been in clinical practice in A yurveda   and in trade since a long time, their role in \npharmacology and t herapeutics have not been elucidated. The unfortunate effect of this can be \nseen in the monographs, where assay limits have been set for possible active chemical entities \non theoretical grounds and not on clinical data. It has not been possible to decide definitely, which major element or minor element or trace elements present in such a complex material (an ore) would contribute to the recorded curative properties of the drug using that mineral/metal, and, on that evidence, set a range of upper and lower l imit. Hopefully, future \nresearch may throw light on such aspects and help improve or rationalize the standards.  \n          The sophisticated analytical methods that are invariably carried out using costly \nimported machinery, is a deterrent to their introdu ction in the A yurvedic pharmacopoeia. India  \nstill lives in its villages and 75 percent of the rural and remote households still depend on traditional medicines. There is no use in having methods that ensure excellent analytical performance of a drug, but t he drug itself is inaccessible to the one who needs it, because of \nthe cost factor. Keeping this aspect in view, the APC has strived for a compromise, using much simpler methods and prescribing standards that are weighted rather heavily on parameters that ensure correct identity, established purity at the expense of an accurate estimation of strength. This is also in keeping with the belief that quality medicines in \n\u00a1yurveda for public use can well be promoted by using a correctly identified and purified ra w \nmaterial and following GMPs prescribed both by Ayur veda and modern pharmaceutics, even \nif its mode is unknown.  \n          In the above paragraphs, only a few important impediments to the development of \nquality standards for A yurvedic medicines have been outlined so as to keep them at par with \naccepted norms for modern medicines. There are many more grey areas to be tackled, \nespecially in compound formulations using geochemicals  like Bhasmas and Rasayogas, but with these words, we offer this volume for public use and welcome comments and criticisms to enhance its value in future revisions.  \n                                                                                           \nMembers of APC  \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 31, "text": " XXX  Annexure to Special Introduction \n \nMINUTES OF THE 1ST MEETING  HELD ON 12TH & 13TH JUNE, 2000 WITH THE \nEXPERTS OF \u2018RASA SHASTRA\u2019, GEOLOGY\u2019 & OTHER SCEINTISTS TO \nCLARIFY ISSUES RELATING TO THE MINERALS & METAL SINGLE DRUG \nUSED IN AYURVEDIC FORMULATIONS.  \n \n A meeting was called for by the Adviser (Ayurveda), Ministry of  Health & Family \nWelfare, on the 12th and 13th of June  2000, to discuss the format, and identity of the mineral \ndrugs included in the Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part -I and II.

Broad classification:  Sulphide  \n \n4. Origin and occurrence: Svar\u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika, in ore form,  occurs mainly in \nmetamorphic rocks of pre -cambrian age. Occurrence of 100% pure Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika \nin abundance is not common because it is always associated with host rock in the \nform of disseminations, streaks, stringers, patches, veins or lodes as fracture and \ncleavage fillings. Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika generally occurs in association with pyrrhotite, \npyrite, sphalerite and galena minerals. Gold, Silver, Arsenic, Nickel and Cobalt in \ntrace amounts, are always pres ent in Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika. \n \n  In India, large deposits of  Svar\u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika occur  mainly in Khetri, Distt. \nJhunjhunu in Rajasthan, Malanjkhand, Distt.

Broad classification:  Sulphide  \n \n3.    Origin and occurrence: There is no natural occurrence of S\u0101ndrita Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika \nin India or in the world. It is a processed material in the form of fine powder. Beneficiation is done by crushing and grinding of Svar\n\u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika and subjecting its \nslurry  to froth floation. It is important to note that even aft er processing, it retains its \noverall mineralogy as well as other properties. The only difference is increase in \ncopper content to more than 12 %. There is a little increase in the content of other \nmajor ingredients also. Like Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika, it also contains trace but comparatively \nhigher amount of Gold, Silver, Arsenic, Lead, Zinc, Nickel and Cobalt.  \n \n   In India, large quantity of S\u0101ndrita Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika is produced by \nHindusthan Copper Limited at Khetri in Rajasthan, Malanjkhand in Madhya pradesh \n& Ghatsh eela in Jharkhand.  \n \n 3.1     Preparation of Sandrit  Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika: \n   \n The S\u0101ndrita Svar \u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika is produced by crushing and grinding of \nSvar\u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika ore lumps to 200 mesh size powder. Substantial amount of \nwater (@ 2.5 M3 per ton ne of ore ground) is ad ded during grinding of \ncopper ore to make the material a slurry. This slurry is subjected to froth \nfloation process, durin g which pine oil (@ 28 g per tonne  of ore ground) \nand sodium ethyl xanthate (@ 35 g per tonne  of ore ground) are added to \nthe flotatio n cells. The pine oil acts as frother whereas sodium ethyl \nxanthate as collector. This process enriches the copper content of the slurry just by discarding the gangue material from it. The enriched slurry, which comes out of floatation cells as froth, is dried through hot air driers. The dried fine powder of 200 mesh size is termed as Concentrate and the \nprocess is called beneficiation.\n The minor amount of pine oil and sodium \nethyl xanthate, which was added during floatation process, will totally go away du ring further processing (i.e.  \u015bodhana) by the pharmacies. Hence, \nthe material, which remains after \u015b odhana, will be nothing but  S\u0101ndrita \nSvar\n\u00b4am\u0101k \u00beika containing higher content of its ingredients.

Where substances are to be \u201caccurately weighed\u201d, the weighing is to be performed so as to \nlimit the error to not more than 0.1 per cent. For example, a quantity of 50 mg  is to be weighed to \nthe nearest 0.05 mg; a quantity of 0.1 g is to be weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg; and quantity of 10 g is to be weighed to the nearest 10 mg.

Microscopic identification tests are conf ined \nto those formulations where the botanical ingredients are not more than ten , and where they are \nadded \u2018in situ\u2019  in powder form as \u2018 Praksepa Dravy \u00a2s\u2019. Such comminuted ingredients lend \nthemselves for microscopic identification, as they are not drastically changed in cell structure or \ncontents while processing, and appear intact in microscopic slide preparations, after proper treatment.  \n  Appropriate processing for separation and isolation of botanical debris from a formulation \nwithout loss of debris, by hand picking, shifting, washing, sedimentation, density separation or by \nfloatation etc., are the preliminary steps. This is followed by clearing the debris in chemical reagents, reacting it with suitable reagents and stains and finally mounting a little p art on a slide in \na medium of suitable refractive index (see later part) that helps to show the unit structures in good relief.  Identification of the discrete, but disoriented units from the botanical ingredients in a formulation will not be possible with out proper isolation, and should not be attempted.  \n  Monographs where the test is prescribed give both a relevant method of isolation and \ndiagnostic features specific to the expected ingredients in that formulation.  Only a brief method and a few of the ch aracteristics for each ingredient are given, but an analyst may use other methods \nof isolation and choose more characteristics to draw a correct conclusion.  \n  Although monographs prescribe standards only for the \u2018 Praksepa Dravyas\u2019, characteristics \nfrom oth er ingredients that are processed into extracts or decoctions prior to their addition to a \nformulation may also be seen in a slide preparation, giving rise to recognisable unique characteristics. In addition, cell or tissue structures common to several ing redients added to a \nformulation, and therefore not specific to any one of them, would also be present. Caution should therefore be exercised so that such features are not construed as parts from adulterants or substitutes or foreign parts.  Proper study of  the individual ingredients using authentic material and reference \nto their monographs in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia for Single Drugs would help avoid errors of this nature.  Skill in the recognition of discrete and disoriented tissue components and the knowledge required to ascribe them to their correct source should be acquired by the analyst.  \n Stains and Reagents for Microchemical Reactions  \n  \nThe Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia volumes on single drugs already include microchemical reactions for ergastic substan ces and may be consulted in addition to the following for use on isolated debris:  \n Acetic acid:  Dilute 6 ml of glacial acetic acid with 100 ml of distilled water; used for identification \nof cystoliths, which dissolve with effervescence.  \n Aniline chloride  solution:  Dissolve 2 g in a mixture of 65 ml of 30 per cent ethyl alcohol and 15 \nml distilled water and add 2 ml of conc.

Microscopical Methods of Examining Crude Vegetable Drugs  \n \nMethods of preparing specimens of crude materials of vegetable drugs for microscopical \nstudies vary, depending on the morphological groups of drugs to b e examined and also on the \nnatures of the material i.e., entire, cut or powdered.  \nI. LEAVES, HERBS AND FLOWERS  \n \nFor examining leaves, herbs and flowers (entire or cut) under microscope, following \nmethods are employed for clarification: \n \nA. Entire and cut mat erials  \n \n(i) Entire materials  \u2013 When examining entire leaves, herbs and flowers, take pieces of leaf \n(margin and vein of leaves only), herbs (only leaf) and flowers (only calyx and corolla) in test tube. \nAdd a solution of caustic alkali or nitric acid to th e test tube and boil for 1- 2 minutes, pour the \ncontents into a porcelain dish, drain off the liquid, wash the material with water and leave for sometimes. Remove the pieces of the material from the water with a spatula and put on the slide, add a few drops  of the solution of glycerol or chloral hydrate. Crush the material with scalpel and \ncover with cover slip before examining.  \n \n(ii) Cut materials  \u2013 For examining cut leaves, herbs and flowers, take several pieces in a \ntest tube and employ the same methods a s described for entire materials.  \n \nOther methods employed for clarification of the material (leaf and stem) are described \nbelow : - \n \n(a) Leaf  \u2013 Boil pieces of leaves in a test tube with chloral hydrate for several minutes until \ncompletely clarified and then  examine them in chloral hydrate solution. After clarification, leaf \npieces are divided into two parts with the help of a scalpel or needle, and carefully turn one part. The leaf can be examined from both the dorsal and ventral surfaces.  \n \n(b) Stem  \u2013 To examine stem material (without leaf) boil pieces in a solution of caustic alkali \nor in nitric acid. Remove the epidermis with a scalpel or a needle for examining the surface.

Powder  \n \nFor examining characters of the powder take sufficient amount of powder in Chloral -\nhydrate solution on a slide and cover it with a cover slip, warm over a low flame for a short time. \n \nII. FRUITS AND SEEDS  \n A. Entire materials  \n \nFor microscopical examination of fruit and seed take the specimens or outer coat of \nseed or fruit and examine as described below :  \n \n(i) Outer Coat  \u2013 For examining the outer coat boil 3 or 4 seeds or fruits in caustic alkali \nsolution in a test tube for 1- 2 min utes (outer coat specimens with intensive pigmentation are boiled \nfor longer period). After boiling, place the pieces on slide, remove the layers of the coat and examine them after mounting in glycerol solution.  \n \n(ii) Section  \u2013 If fruits or seeds are too h ard to cut then boil them for 15 -30 minutes or more \ndepending on their hardness or keep them in moistening chamber or absorb in water and chloroform solution or soften them with stem and then cut the specimen for examining purpose. For cutting small, flat seeds (which are difficult to hold) place them in a pith or potato slit for section cutting. Small, round or smooth seeds cannot be cut into section in the pith, then in such cases, they may be embedded in paraffin wax blocks for section cutting. For this, a block of paraffin (0.6 \u00d7 0.5 \n\u00d7 1.5 cms. in size) is made and the seed is embedded in the block by making a cavity or a pit in the block with a hot teasing needle. Cut the section with a sharp razor (through the object) together with the paraffin, place them on to the slide, remove paraffin with a needle or wash it with xylene and examine the section in chloral -hydrate solution. \n \nB. Powder  \n \nFor examining the structure of the cells of the seed coat and the cells of the embryo take a small \namount of powder of the material on a slide in glycerol and cover it with a cover slip and examine.  \n \n1. Starch  \u2013 For examining the presence of starch in the seed, take two specimens, one in iodine \nsolution and the other in water. With iodine solution starch turns blue. Shape and the structure of starch grains can be seen in water and their size is measured.  \n  When examining objects containing starch, prepare specimen by slightly warming in \nchloral -hydrate solution. \n 2. Fixed Oil  \u2013 For examining the presence of fixed oil, prepa re a specimen in a solution of Sudan \nIII droplets of fixed oil are coloured orange pink. When examining objects containing small amount of fixed oil, prepare a specimen by slightly warming in chloral -hydrate solution, and when \nexamining objects containing large amount of fixed oil, then the powder is de -fatted and clarified as \nfollows:  \n \nPlace 0.5 g. of the powder in a porcelain dish, add 5- 10 ml. of dilute nitric acid  \nand boil for 1 minute, then strain off the liquid through a cloth, wash the residue with hot water and return it to the porcelain dish with a spatula, boil it with 5 -10 ml of caustic alkali solution for 1 \nminute and again strain it through the cloth and wash with water.

Mucilage  \u2013 Prepare a specimen in Ruthenium Red and examine it under a low power microscope \nor under dissecting microscope. Mucilage appears as pinkish- red or yellow coloured mass es. \n \nIII. BARKS  \n \nA. Entire material  \n \nPrepare transverse or longitudinal section of bark. To soften bark break it into pieces of \nabout 1- 2 cm long and 0.5- 1 cm wide and boil with in a test tube for 1- 3 minutes. Soft pieces are \nthen straightened with a scalp el so as to have a exact transverse or longitudinal direction. Cut the \nsection with razor, moisten the surface of the bark with glycerol solution. Remove the sections with a brush and place them on the slide. Thin pieces of the bark are cut by placing them  in the pith \n(potato or carrot). The sections are treated with various reagents before examining.  1. Lignified elements  \u2013 For testing lignin add several drops of phloroglucinol and a drop of \nconcentrated hydrochloric acid to the section on a slide then dr aw off the liquid, immerse the \nsection in chloral hydrate solution and cover with a cover slip (the specimen should not be heated); the lignified elements are coloured crimson. Phloroglucinol can be substituted by saffranine, and the lignified elements are  coloured pink. The excessive stain can be washed out with acidified \nalcohol.  2. Starch  \u2013 Starch is detected by treating with iodine solution.  \n 3. Tannin  \u2013Tannin is detected by treating with ferric ammonium sulphate solution (blue -black or \ngreen black col our shows the presence of Tannin) or with potassium -bichromate solution (brown \ncolour indicates the presence of Tannin).  \n 4. Anthraquinone derivatives  \u2013Anthraquinone derivatives are detected by treating with alkali \nsolution (blood- red colour shows the pres ence of  anthraquinone derivatives). \n \nB. Cut materials  \n \nPrepare small pieces or scraping of bark and boil them for 3- 5 minutes in a solution of caustic \nalkali or potassium hydroxide or in nitric acid solution and then mount in glycerin for examination \non a sl ide covered with a cover slip.  \n \nC. Powder  \n \nPrepare specimen for examination by placing a little amount of powder on a slide, add 1 -2 \ndrops of phloroglucinol and a drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid, cover it with a cover slip, \ndraw off the liquid from one  side of the slide with filter paper, and then apply 1- 2 drops of chloral -\nhydrate solution from the other side of the slide, lignified elements are stained crimson- red. \nSpecimen may also be prepared with caustic alkali or ferric ammonium sulphate for this purpose.  \n IV. ROOTS AND RHIZOMES  \n \nA. Entire materials  \n \nFor anatomical examination of entire roots and rhizomes cut transverse and longitudinal \nsections.

The softened roots are straightened with the help of a scalpel in the \nright direction and then cut a section with the razor. First, cut thicker entire slices and then make \nthin, smaller sections. Stain the entire slices with phloroglucinol and  concentrated hydrochloric acid \nor with safranin examine the specimen under a dissecting microscope. For micro- chemical test the \nsmall and thin sections are examined under microscope, as follows:  \n 1. Starch  \u2013 Starch is detected with iodine solution. For th is, prepare specimen with water to \nmeasure the granule of starch with an occular micrometer.  \n 2. Inulin \u2013Inulin is detected with Molish\u2019s reagent. For this place a little powder on a slide and \napply 1- 2 drops of naphthol and a drop of concentrated sulphuri c acid, if inulin is present, the \npowder will appear reddish- violet coloured. Starch also gives this test, so the test for inulin can be \ndone in the absence of starch.  \n \n3. Lignified elements  \u2013Lignified elements (fibrovascular bundles, mechanical tissue etc.) are \ndetected with phloroglucinol and concentrated hydrochloric acid or safranine solution as mentioned \nabove for barks.  \n \n4. Fixed oil  \u2013For fixed oil detection use Sudan IV, as mentioned above for fruits and seeds.  \n \nIf required for tannin, anthraquinone derivatives test as mentioned above.  \n \nB.

Types of Stomata  \n \nThere are several types of stomata, distinguished by the form and arrangement of the \nsurrounding cells. The following descriptions apply to mature stomata.  \n \n1. Anomoc ytic (irregular- celled)  \u2013Previously known as ranunculaceous. The stoma is surrounded \nby a varying number of cells in no way differing form those of the epidermis generally.  \n 2. Anisocytic (unequal -celled)  \u2013Previously known as cruciferous or  solanaceous. T he stoma is \nusually surrounded by three subsidiary cells, of which one is markedly smaller than the others.  \n 3. Diacytic (cross -celled)  \u2013previously known as caryophyllaceous. The stoma is accompanied by \ntwo subsidiary cells whose common wall is at right an gles to the guard cells.  \n 4. Paracytic (parallel -celled)  \u2013Previously known as rubiaceous. The stoma has one each side one \nor more subsidiary cells parallel to the long axis of the pore and guard cells. \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 101, "text": " 240 2.1.4.

This s olution, referred to as the `test solution\u2019, is used in the actual test. \n General Test  - The glass tube is lightly packed with cotton wool, previously moistened with lead \nacetate solution and dried, so that the upper surface of the cotton wool is not less than 25 mm \nbelow the top of the tube. The upper end of the tube is then inserted into the narrow end of one of the pair of rubber bungs, either to a depth of about 10 mm when the tube has a rounded- off end, or \nso that the ground end of the tube is flush wi th the larger end of the bung. A piece of mercuric \nchloride paper is placed flat on the top of the bung and the other bung placed over it and secured by means of the rubber band or spring clip in such a manner that the borings of the two bungs (or the uppe r bung and the glass tube) meet to form a true tube 6.5 mm in diameter interrupted by a \ndiaphrag m of mercuric chloride paper. \n  Instead of this method of attaching the mercuric chloride paper, any other method may be \nused provided (1) that the whole of the  evolved gas passes through the paper; (2) that the portion of \nthe paper in contact with the gas is a circle 6.5 mm in diameter; and (3) that the paper is protected from sunlight during the test. The test solution prepared as specified, is placed in the wi de-mouthed \nbottle, 1 g of potassium iodide AsT and 10 g of zinc AsT  added, and the prepared glass tube is \nplaced quickly in position. The action is allowed to proceed for 40 minutes. The yellow stain which is produced on the mercuric chloride paper if arsenic is present is compared by day light with the standard stains produced by operating in a similar manner with known quantities of dilute arsenic solution AsT . The comparison of the stains is made immediately at the completion of the test. The  \nstandard st ains used for comparison are freshly prepared; they fade on keeping.  \n  By matching the depth of colour with standard stains , the proportion of arsenic in the \nsubstance may be determined. A stain equivalent to the 1- ml standard stain, produced by operating \non 10 g of substance indicates that the proportion of arsenic is 1 part per million.  \n N\nOTE: (1) The action may be accelerated by placing the apparatus on a warm surface, care being \ntaken that the mercuric chloride paper remains dry throughout the test.  \n \n(2) The most suitable temperature for carrying out the test is generally about 400 but \nbecause the rate of the evolution of the gas varies somewhat with different batches zinc AsT, the temperature may be adjusted to obtain a regular, but not violent, evolution o f \ngas. \n (3) The tube must be washed with hydrochloric acid AsT , rinsed with water and dried \nbetween successive tests.  \n \nStandard Stains  - Solutions are prepared by adding to 50 ml of water, 10 ml of stannated \nhydrochloric acid AsT  and quantities of dilute arsenic solutions AsT varying from 0.2 ml to 1 ml. \nThe resulting solutions, when treated as described in the General Test, yield stains on the mercuric \nchloride paper referred to as the standard stains.  \n \nPreparation of the Test Solution  \n \n In the various methods  of preparing the test solution given below, the quantities are so \narranged unless otherwise stated, that when the stain produced from the solution to be examined is not deeper than the 1- ml standard stain , the proportion of arsenic present does not exceed the \npermitted limit.  \n "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 117, "text": " 256 Ammonium chloride  - Dissolve 2.5 g in 50 ml of water, and 10 ml of stannated hydrochloric acid \nAsT.  \n Boric acid  - Dissolve 10 g with 2 g of citric acid AsT   in 50 ml water, and add 12 ml of stannated \nhydrochloric acid AsT.

The assay of the element being examined is tested by determining the decreased degree of light intensity of radiation. Atomic absorption obeys the general rule for absorption spect rophotometry. The assay is carried out by comparing the \nabosorbance of the test preparation with that of the reference preparation.  \n \nApparatus  \n \nAn atomic absorption spectrophotometer consists of a light source, an atomic generator, a \nmonochromator and a de tector system. Some are equipped with a background compensation system \nand automatic sampling system, etc.  \n1. Light Source : A hollow -cathode discharge lamp is usually used. The cathode is made of the \nelement being examined.  \n 2. Atomic Generator: There are four main types : flame atomizer, graphite furnace atomizer, \nhydride -generated atomizer, cold vapor atomizer.  \n (1) Flame atomizer : It mainly consists of a nebulizer and a burner. Its function is to nebulize the \ntest solution into aerosol, which is mixed wi th combustion gas. And the mixture is introduced into \nthe flame generated by the burner. So that the substance being examined is to be dried, evaporated to form the ground state atoms of the element being examined. The burning flame is generated by differe nt mixtures of gases, acetylene -air is mostly used. By modifying the proportion of \ncombustion gas, the temperature of the flame can be controlled and a better stability and a better \nsensitivity can be obtained. "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 123, "text": " 262  \n(2) Furnace atomizer: It consists of electric furnace and a power supply. Its function is to dry and \nincinerate the substance being examined. During the stage of high temperature atomization, the ground state atoms of the element being examined are to be formed. Graphite is commonly used as the heat er. Protection gas is introduced into the furnace to avoid oxidation and used to transfer the \nsample vapor.  \n (3) Hydride -generated atomizer:  It consists of hydride generator and atomic absorption cell. It is \nused for the determination of the elements such as arsenic, selenium and antimony etc. Its function is to reduce the element to be examined in acidic medium to the low -boiling and easily pyrolyzed \nhydride. The hydride is then swept by a stream of carrier gas into the atomic absorption cell which consist s of quartz tube and heater etc., in which the hydride is pyrolyzed by heating to form the \nground -state atom.  \n (4) Cold vapor atomizer : It consists of a mercury vapor atomizer and an absorption cell. It is \nsuitable for the determination of mercury. Its fun ction is to reduce the mercuric ion into mercury \nvapor which is swept into the quartz absorption cell by carrier gas.  \n \n3. Monochromator : Its function is to separate the specified wavelength radiation from the \nelectromagnetic radiations er radiated from the light source. The optical path of the apparatus should \nassure the good spectra resolution and has the ability to work well at the condition of narrow \nspectral band (0.2 nm). The commonly used wavelength region is 190.0 -  900.0 nm. \n 4. Detector system : It consists of a detector, a signal processor and a recording system. It should \nhave relatively higher sensitivity and better stability and can follow the rapid change of the signal absorption. \n \n5. Background compensation system : System employed for the correction of atmospheric effects \non the measuring system. Four principles can be utili zed for background compensation: continuous \nspectrum sources (a deuterium lamp is often used in the UV region), the Zeeman effect, the self \ninversion phenomenon and the non re sonance spectrum. In the analysis using atomic absorption \nspectrophotometry, the interference to the determination caused by background and other reasons should be noticed. Changes of some experimental conditions, such as the wavelength, the slit width, the atomizing condition, etc., may affect the sensitivity, the stability and the interference. If it is flame, the suitable wavelength, slit width and flame temperature, the addition of complexing agents and releasing agents and the use of Standard addition method may eliminate interference. If it is furnace, system, the selection of suitable background compensation system and the addition of suitable matrix modifying agents, etc may remove the interference. Background compensation method shall be selected as  specified in the individual monograph.  \n \nProcedure  \n \nMethod  (direct calibration method)  \nPrepare not less than 3 reference solutions of the element being examined of different \nconcentrations, covering the range recommended by the instrument manufacturer and add \nseparately the corresponding reagents as that for the test solution and prepare the blank reference solution with the corresponding reagents. Measure the absorbances of the blank reference solution and each reference solution of different concentratio ns separately, record the readings and prepare a \ncalibration curve with the average value of 3 readings of each concentration on the ordinate and the corresponding concentration on the abscissa.  \n \nPrepare a test solution of the substance being examined as s pecified in the monograph, \nadjust the concentration to fall within the concentration range of the reference solution.

The term \u2018growth\u2019 is used to designate the presence and presumed proliferation of \nviable micro -organisms. \n Preliminary Testing   \nThe methods given herein are invalid unless it is demonstrated that the test specimens to \nwhich they a re applied do not, of themselves, inhibit the multiplication under the test conditions of \nmicro -organisms that can be present. Therefore, prior to doing the tests, inoculate diluted \nspecimens of the substance being examined with separate viable cultures of  Escherichia coli , \nSalmonella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus . This is done by adding 1 \nml of not less than 10\n-3 dilutions of a 24 h broth culture of the micro- organisms to the first dilution \n(in buffer solution pH 7.2, fluid soya bean -casein digest medium or fluid lactose medium) of the test \nmaterial and following the test procedure. If the organisms fail to grow in the relevant medium the procedure should be modified by (a) increasing the volume of diluent with the quantity of tes t \nmaterial remaining the same, or (b) incorporating a sufficient quantity of a suitable inactivating agent in the diluents, or (c) combining the aforementioned modifications so as to permit growth of the organisms in the media. If inhibitory substances are  present in the sample, 0.5 per cent of soya \nlecithin and 4 per cent of polysorbate 20 may be added to the culture medium. Alternatively, repeat \nthe test as described in the previous paragraph, using fluid casein digest -soya lecithin -polysorbate \n20 medium to demonstrate neutralization of preservatives or other antimicrobial agents in the test material. Where inhibitory substances are contained in the product and the latter is soluble, the Membrane filtration method described under Total Aerobic Microbial Count may be used.  \n \nIf in spite of incorporation of suitable inactivating agents and a substantial increase in the \nvolume of diluent it is still not possible to recover the viable cultures described above and where the article is not suitable for applying th e membrane filtration method it can be assumed that the \nfailure to isolate the inoculated organism may be due to the bactericidal activity of the product. This may indicate that the article is not likely to be contaminated with the given species of micro -\norganisms. However, monitoring should be continued to establish the spectrum of inhibition and bactericidal activity of the article.  \n  \nMedia   \nCulture media may be prepared as given below or dehydrated culture media may be used \nprovided that, when reconstit uted as directed by the manufacturer, they have similar ingredients and \n/ or yield media comparable to those obtained from the formulae given below. \n \nWhere agar is specified in a formula, use agar that has a moisture content of not more than \n15 per cent.

The carrier gas flows \nthrough the column at a controlled rate or pressure and then through the detector.  "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 148, "text": " 287 The chromatography is carried out either at a constant temperature or according to a given \ntemperature programme.  \n \nInjectors  \n \nDirect injections  of solutions are the usual mode of injection, unless otherwise prescribed in \nthe monograph. Inject ion may be carried out either directly at the head of the column using a \nsyringe or an injection valve, or into a vaporization chamber which may be equipped with a stream \nsplitter.  \n Injections of vapour phase  may be effected by static or dynamic head -space injection \nsystems.  \n \nDynamic head -space (purge and trap) injection systems include a sparging device by which \nvolatile substances in solution are swept into an absorbent column maintained at a low temperature. Retained substances are then desorbed into the  mobile phase by rapid heating of the absorbent \ncolumn. \n Static head -space injection systems include a thermostatically controlled sample heating \nchamber in which closed vials containing solid or liquid samples are placed for a fixed period of time to allo w the volatile components of the sample to reach equilibrium between the non- gaseous \nphase and the vapour phase. After equilibrium has been established, a predetermined amount of the head -space of the vial is flushed into the gas chromatograph.  \n \nStationary Phases  \n Stationary phases are contained in columns, which may be:  \n \n- a capillary column of fused -silica close wall is coated with the stationary phase.  \n- a column packed with inert particles impregnated with the stationary phase.  \n- a column packed with solid st ationary phase.  \n \nCapillary columns are 0.1 mm to 0.53 mm in internal diam eter (\u0424) and 5 to 6 m in length.  \nThe liquid or stationary phase, which may be chemically bonded to the inner surface, is a film 0.1 \u00b5m to 5.0 \u00b5m thick.  \nPacked columns, made of glass or metal, are usually 1 m to 3 m in length with an internal \ndiameter (\u0424)  of 2 mm to 4 mm. Stationary phases usually consist of porous polymers or solid \nsupports impregnated with liquid phase.  \nSupports for analysis of polar compounds on columns packed with low -capacity, low -\npolarity stationary phase must be inert to avoid peak tailing. The reactivity of support materials can \nbe reduced by silanising prior to coating with liquid phase. Acid- washed, flux -calcinated \ndiatomaceous earth is often used. Materials are available in various particle sizes, the most commonly used particle s are in the ranges of 150 \u00b5m to 180 \u00b5m and 125 \u00b5m to 150 \u00b5m.   \n \nMobile Phases  \n \nRetention time and peak efficiency depend on the carrier gas flow rate; retention time is \ndirectly proportional to column length and resolution is proportional to the square root of the column length. For packed columns, the carrier gas flow rate is usually expressed in milliliters per minute at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, flow rate is measured at the detector outlet, \neither with a calibrated mechanical device or with a bubble tube, while the column is at operating "}, {"file": "API-Vol-7.pdf", "page_number": 149, "text": " 288 temperature. The linear velocity of the carrier gas through a packed column is inversely \nproportional to the square root of the internal diameter of the column for a given flow volume. Flow rates of 60 m l/min in a 4 mm internal diameter column and 15 ml/min in a 2 mm internal \ndiameter column, give identical linear velocities and thus similar retention times.  \n \nHelium or nitrogen is usually employed as the carrier gas for packed columns, whereas \ncommonly us ed carrier gases for capillary columns are nitrogen, helium and hydrogen.  \n Detectors  \n \nFlame -ionisation detectors are usually employed but additional detectors which may be used \ninclude: electron -capture, nitrogen -phosphorus, mass spectrometric, thermal conductivity, Fourier \ntransform infrared spectrophotometric and others, depending on the purpose of the analysis.  \n \nMethod  \n \nEquilibrate the column, the injector and the detector at the temperatures and the gas flow \nrates specified in the monograph until a stab le baseline is achieved.

PHYSICAL TESTS AND DETERMINATIONS  \n \n3.1.1.  - REFRACTIVE INDEX \n \n The refractive index ( \u03b7) of a substance with reference to air is the ratio of the sine of the \nangle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction of a beam of l ight passing from air into the \nsubstance. It varies with the wavelength of the light used in its measurement. \n  Unless otherwise prescribed, the refractive index is measured at 25\n0 (\u00b10.5) with reference to \nthe wavelength of the D line of sodium (\u03bb 589.3 nm ). The temperature should be carefully adjusted \nand maintained since the refractive index varies significantly with temperature.  \n \nThe Abbe\u2019s refractometer is convenient for most measurements of refractive index but other \nrefractometer of equal or greater accuracy may be used. Commercial refractometers are normally constructed for use with white light but are calibrated to give the refractive index in terms of the D line of sodium light.  \n To achieve accuracy, the apparatus should be calibrated against distilled water which has a \nrefractive index of 1.3325 at 25\n0 or against the reference liquids given in the T able 3.1.  \n \nTable 3.1 \n_______________________________________________________________________  \n Reference        \u03b7\n D20\u00ba             Temperature  \nLiquid                                Co -efficient    \n                                  \u0394n/\u0394t  \n Carbon tetrachloride     1.4603   -0.00057 \nToluene      1.4969   -0.00056 \n\u03b1-Methylnaphthalene     1.6176   -0.00048 \n________________________________________________________________________ \n* Reference index value for the D line of sodium, measured at 20\n0 \n \nThe cleanliness of the instrument should be checked frequently by determining the \nrefractive index of distilled water, which at 250 is 1.3325. \n \n3.1.2. -  WEIGHT PER MILLILITRE AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY \n     A.

The \n\u2018Rasa\u2019 of different substances have definite relationship to the increase or decrease of Dosha and they have certain actions in the body. The drugs are selected keeping in view their rasas (taste) and the predominate do shas in the body of the patient. There are six types of rasas \n(tastes) .

According to the most commonly held view vi rya is of \ntwo kinds: usna (literal meaning; hot) and sita (literal meaning: cold).  "}]
