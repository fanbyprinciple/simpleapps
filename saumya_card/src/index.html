          Today driving to office<br />
          weather I did review<br />
          Soft december delhi rain<br /> 
          has finally made its debut<br />
          I wondered what made the heavens open<br />
          is it guilt ridden for a monsoon long past due? <br />
          Are these showers just a measly compensation in lieu <br />
          Did it shudder (like me) at the thought of another covid curfew<br />
          or is it merely in celebration  <br />
          for Gods are wishing happy birthday to you.<br />
